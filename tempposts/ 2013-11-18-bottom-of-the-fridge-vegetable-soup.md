My happiest day in the kitchen is when my fortnightly vege box arrives,    full of beautiful seasonal fruit and veg with recipes to match. I get a ten minute catch-up with my gorgeous friend Mindy, who never fails to make me laugh, and then the kids unpack the box with me, snacking as they go.  I spend some delicious time planning the upcoming menu, deciding on what's going to go off first, and writing up the meals on my kitchen blackboard.

Try as I might to get through the box, each fortnight we reach a point where we need to finish up or chuck out the stragglers. There's a few good ways to polish off a pile of veges, but my favourite is this anything-goes, hearty, easy-as vegetable soup.

It goes like this:

1. Gently fry off diced onions, shallots and garlic in a good glug of olive oil and a chunk of butter.

2. Give the kids a chopping board each, and a knife depending on ages (butter knives are fine, and will cut zucchini or top and tail beans. The two-year old gets a banana to trash beyond repair.) Get them chopping up small chunks of any veg you have: eggplant, carrot, potato, broccoli, mushroom: anything. Throw all the veges in to fry off  - don't worry about varying cooking times, just chuck them all in there.

3. Fill up your pan or pot with a good litre of chicken stock (home-made from the freezer, or from a packet), and top up with water if you still have a lot of vegges poking up.

4. Chuck in a good handful of red lentils.

5. Let the whole mess bubble away on a simmer for about half an hour, then chuck in some peas (frozen is fine), green beans, or spinach if you have them, and cook that away for another five or ten minutes.

6. Do a taste test to see that everything is nice and tender, and season generously with salt and pepper.

7. Get out the stick blender and give everything a good going over until it is mostly smooth. It may be a fairly grim colour by now, depending on the combination of veges you've found at the bottom of the fridge. But never mind! A generous spoonful of sour cream and a sprinkling of lovely verdant parsley will make everything beautiful.

Bon appetit! And if you are in Sydney, or the south coast, you can find Mindy's tasty box at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thevegebox">her Facebook page.</a> I do seem to be plugging a lot of books and things on this new blog. None of them are sponsored, FYI. I'm just talking.

But now, I'm off to cook up some souvlaki and find Nana Mouscouri on Spotify. It's Greek Night!
