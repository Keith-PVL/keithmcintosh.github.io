# Bookshelf: Political Life Of A Speechwriter

## 16th September 2015

This week,   as we elected a sliver fox to the head positiion of our country,   I happen to be reading a really interesting book about the Australian Parliament.

 

crikey post about it:Â http://www.crikey.com.au/2012/09/18/speechwriter-speaks-james-button-and-public-service-confidentiality/

James Button, the son of late ALP Senator John Button, wrote a book about the year he spent in the public servive writing speeches for Kevin Rudd.

 

It is part, a sons love letter to his father, in part, a carefull dissection of the art of writiong, and in part, an outsiders look at a visit into the vast machinery of public servive.
