# Canned Goods and Arrogant Dandies

## 9th June 2014

<img class="photo-horiz" src="/images/2014/06/RegencyBuck.jpg" />

Tintin,   Play School,   baked beans,   Regency romance. That's how we be rolling around here on this rainy Monday, while Keith is across the seas and a section of my spine keeps threatening to pop out of its proper alignment and say hello.

Times like this a lady needs to resort to canned goods and escape to the sixteenth century, home of arrogant dandies like the incorrigible Lord Worth.

<blockquote>

<p He was the epitome of a man of fashion. His beaver hat was set over black locks carefully brushed into a semblance of disorder; his cravat of starched muslin supported his chin in a series of beautiful folds; his driving-coat of drab cloth bore no less than fifteen capes, and a double row of silver buttons.</p>

</blockquote>

<p Ding dong!  May your public holiday Monday be unfolding as loosely as the washing that has engulfed my couch, and may your spines go not a -travelling.</p>
