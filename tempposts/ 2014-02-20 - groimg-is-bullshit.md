Have you ever heard the old phrase 'Makeup is an apology for your actual face?'

As I meander into my forties, I'm definitely noticing my face change . Sometimes it's a shock seeing a middle-ages women in the mirror. Most of the time I still feel thirteen on the inside. (A mature thirteen, of course.)

Keeping myself hair-free, trimmed, respectable takes too muh time. If any one part of me is groomed to post-millenial standards, you can be sure that the rest is shamefully decrepit.  Who has time to keep up with the modern demands of grooming? Shiny, smooth hair, tanned skin, good nails, arched eyebrows, hairless legs, make-up...

I like clothes and fashion and looking nice as much as the next

If taking oneself seriously as a woman means committing to a life of grooming, pumicing, pruning and polishing one’s exterior for the benefit of onlookers, then I may as well heave my unwieldy rucksack to the top of a bleak Scottish hill and make my home there under a stone, where I’ll fashion shoes out of mud.

Miranda Hart.

I like Anne Roiphe here:  'A woman whose smile is open and whose expression is glad has a kind of beauty no matter what she wears.'

 

Good news for me! I have a pair of undies holding back my hair, but I'm really happy regardless.
