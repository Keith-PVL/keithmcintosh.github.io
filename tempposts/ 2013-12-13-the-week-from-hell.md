# The Week From Hell

## 13th December 2013

<p Man, am I glad that winter is over.</p>

<p Barely had time to put my face on.</p>

Friends, here’s my understatement of the year: I am tired. And by ‘tired’, I mean ‘exhausted-to-the-bone-might-cry-any-second-even-my-hair-hurts’.  You see, my three small children are the joy of my life. But they are, like all kids at school and pre-school and day-care, poxy little bastards. They bring home every bacteria and virus in the neighbourhood and give them to me, like little kittens presenting bloodied mice. This winter has been particularly bad for illness in our house, and this last week has been the worst ever.

I’ve been fantasising about those hazy days, pre-children, when a ‘sick day’ meant a day in bed watching Dr Phil and sleeping for hours. Alas, those beautiful days are long gone. It’s all about soldiering on now; rocking the snotty, spluttering, pale-faced hag look, leaving a trail of tissues in my wake and coughing like an old smoker. My husband Keith went under too, so the machinery of the whole household just fell apart.

Flu bugs always seem to strike when the calendar is groaning with events. This week we had two kid birthdays, requiring lots of late night present-wrapping, baking, special dinners, cupcakes for pre-school and family parties. I kept it as low-key as I could, but still, cooking spaghetti bolognaise and setting a party table for seven while icing a birthday cake is tough while evil bacteria are having a party in your bloodstream.

All week, I lay on the floor letting the toddler draw on my legs with texta, took every possible opportunity to slink off to bed for a rest, and shelved every non-essential housework task for later. It took all my energy to maintain the minimum: the critical washing-up, the supermarketing, the scrubbing of weet-bix cement off the school uniform, the spew wash.  All the second-level house management went by the wayside as we scrabbled like hobos for clean clothes through a giant pile of unfolded laundry and picked across a floor carpeted with Lego and tissues.

In the background of all this, I had made the audacious decision to step outside the mama zone and do something completely new. I wrote a short play and crazily agreed to perform it with an actress friend at a cabaret night. So in the midst of spluttering and weeping over the chicken soup, I squeezed in rehearsals and prop-shopping and rewrites.

On the night of the play, I was backstage, snotty and flu-blown, when a report came through that one of the kids had projectile vomited all over the laundry. In timing that was a perfect, ironic fit for my play - a tragi-comedy about motherhood - a gastro bug had taken root in our sorry immune systems. My nausea grew backstage and as I walked on, it was touch and go whether I would hurl over the front row. Thankfully, adrenalin kicked in, and I got through without disgrace.

There was no after-show theatrical triumph for Keith and I, however. No champagne, canapés and compliments. Instead, we raced home to strip beds, shampoo vomit from children’s ears, hack disgracefully into buckets and race for the toilet without *quite* making it in time.  A fitting finale, in fact, for a show about motherhood.

I think it will take me a month to repair the damage of that one week of horrors. Life can be very unpredictable when you have three small children, but there is one sure thing: it is never boring.
