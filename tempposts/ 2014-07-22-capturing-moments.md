<div>And also the time they tried to show passing bushwalkers our naked bums.</div>

<div> but behold the little athlete below,   captured with tell-tale milo moustache. i turned my back yesterday and half-caught ivy whispering 'you can eat as much as you want ted..'</div>

<div></div>

<div>and when i turned around i found teddy,   enthusiastically necking back a huge handful of milo. i sent him to his room but as he whimpered past i remembered the snippet of conversation i had caught.</div>

<div></div>

<div>'wait' - i said 'why did you eat that milo ted? you know that's naughty.'</div>

<div>'ivy said it would turn me into a fairy' he wept.</div>

<div>i changed sides, and sent ivy off in disgrace.</div>

<div>when she came back she had to tell teddy 'i'm sorry for making you do a naughty thing.'</div>
