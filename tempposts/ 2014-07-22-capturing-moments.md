# Capturing Moments

## 22nd July 2014

They love the story of



And also the time they tried to show passing bushwalkers our naked bums.

 but behold the little athlete below,   captured with tell-tale milo moustache. i turned my back yesterday and half-caught ivy whispering 'you can eat as much as you want ted..'



and when i turned around i found teddy,   enthusiastically necking back a huge handful of milo. i sent him to his room but as he whimpered past i remembered the snippet of conversation i had caught.



'wait' - i said 'why did you eat that milo ted? you know that's naughty.'

'ivy said it would turn me into a fairy' he wept.

i changed sides, and sent ivy off in disgrace.

when she came back she had to tell teddy 'i'm sorry for making you do a naughty thing.'



Ivy - headbutt

Ted -

George 'fart bastard' 'giorl amd boy numbers. dress obsessed. fll of affection -  i love you mum! hug-wee.
