# Easy, Freezy, Low-Sugar, Super-Charged Lunchbox Muffins

## 26th February 2014

I've been tinkering  with recipes for banana bread and muffins: good lunchbox and afternoon tea fare that will freeze well . I hate the idea of putting cake in a lunchbox. Baked treats need to be low-sugar and high-GI,   but still yummy, so they will boost energy for the school afternoon, but also get eaten!

By George, I think I've got it.  You try these and let me know. It's a big batch, made for freezing.

**Ingredients:**

4 cups self-raising flour

1/2 cup brown sugar

Pinch of salt

1/2 cup honey

2 eggs

1 tsp vanilla

1 cup butter

2 cups milk

2 mashed ripe bananas

2 cups of frozen blueberries

**Optional superboost: **

**I added 2 tablespoons each of wheatgerm, chia seeds and raw cacao nibs. You can  supercharge with whatever you like or have at hand.  For instance: psylium husk, natural muesli, wheat or oat bran.  LSA mix  (linseed, soy and almond meal, available at health food stores), is delicious for afternoon tea muffins, but if you are cooking for a nut-free school lunchbox, leave it out. For extra sweetness, you could add chopped dates too. I also like to let my little chefs shake nutmeg and cinnamon in, just for the fun of it. As long as your mix is still the consistency of heavy cake batter, your muffins should rise beautifully. Muffins (and children) are very forgiving. **



**Method:**

Basically, muffin recipes all require one wet mix, and one dry mix, combined. This is a great time to get your little soux-chefs in the kitchen.

Melt the butter first, and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 180. Combine flour, sugar and salt in one bowl. Add whatever superboosters you have found in the pantry or stolen from the service station.  (Naughty!)

In your second bowl, beat your eggs, add the bananas and squash them up with the back of a fork. Really get out all your latent stress on those bananas. Add the milk, vanilla, honey, and the cooled butter, and give it all a good mix.

Next, combine the wet mix with the dry.

Finally, stir through the frozen blueberries, without overworking the mix too much.

This recipe makes about 24 good-sized muffins. Spoon muffin trays 3/4 full, and bake for about twenty minutes. (Start checking at fifteen minutes. When they look golden, stick a knife in the centre of a nice fat one, and if it comes out clean, they are done.  Admire them on your bench with your little pineapple-pumpkin display for a minute. (Ignore the washing-up.)

Freeze, then add to lunchboxes and dispense to children with added kisses.

Bon appetit!
