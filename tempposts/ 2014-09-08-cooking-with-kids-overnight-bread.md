# Cooking With Kids: Overnight Bread

## 8th September 2014

Are you familiar with the concept of no-knead bread? This method basically replaces the usual  kneading time with a very long prove on the kitchen counter. This way,   the gluten develops through a long,   slow fermentation and the bread develops a delicious flavour.

We've been making this bread for a few years now. It's a lovely thing for the kids to do - they can mix it after school, leave it to prove overnight, and (if I'm on top of life and up early) we can have fresh bread for breakfast. Otherwise, lunch.



<br />

You can search the web for lots of no-knead bread recipes, but here is ours:  the simplest version of them all. You can throw this baby together in five minutes: the work to pleasure ratio of this recipe is very, very high. (Just mentally prepare yourself to spend a good five minutes scraping messy, sticky dough off the children's fingers.)



<ul>

<br />

<li> 3 cups of flour, 1 3/4 tsp of salt and half a teaspoon of yeast. Use your fingers to spread the dry ingredients around the bowl, which helps to start the yeast activating. (We add a little LSA or kibble grain here too.) Then, add the water and mix until it just comes together into a sloppy ball.</li>

<li>Leave it overnight in a bowl covered in plastic wrap. We tend to make it after school, and bake it in the morning. Anywhere between 12 and 24 hours proving time is OK.</li>

<li>In the morning, take a cast iron pot (I use my Le Crueset here), and heat it, lid on, in the oven at 200 for twenty minutes.</li>

<li>Take the sloppy bread mix out of the bowl and drop it in a little flour on the counter. Flip it over and into your pot, and bake it in the oven (lid on) for half and hour, lid off for another fifteen minutes.</li>

</ul>

So easy, so rewarding. Smelly so good.

Happy baking!
