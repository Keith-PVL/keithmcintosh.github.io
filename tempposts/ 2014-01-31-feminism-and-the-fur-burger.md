# Feminism and The Fur Burger

## 31st January 2014

Who's laughing now,   baldies? Finally, hairy lasses, our day has come!  The <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/01/30/new_york_times_pubic_hair_trend_piece_not_waxing_is_the_new_juicing_or_something.html">New York Times</a> say that  the Brazilian is over and bush is back.

<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/01/30/new_york_times_pubic_hair_trend_piece_not_waxing_is_the_new_juicing_or_something.html">Slate Magazine</a> says it's just an excuse to write an article about fannies and use the phrases: 'overgrown briar patch, matted fairy floss, the nethergrove, corn silk nest of passion, flowing witch beard, sugar-spun twinkle fluff, and Elmo’s shrub garden.'

I see nothing wrong with that and also, will add the visual.

A happy day!  Vindiction for those of us who like to let our fur flags fly, or as my beloved Caitlin Moran would have it:

<div id="content">





<blockquote>Lying in a hammock, gently finger-combing your Wookiee whilst staring up

at the sky is one of the great pleasures of adulthood. By the end of a grooming session,

your little minge-fro should be even, and bouffy – you can gently bounce the palm of

your hand off it, as if it were a tiny hair trampoline.

Walking around a room, undressed, in front of appreciative eyes, the reflection

in the mirror shows the right thing: a handful of darkness between your legs, something you

refuse to hurt. Half animal, half secret – something to be approached with a measure of

reverence, rather than just made to lie there, while cocks are chucked at it like the penultimate

game on It’s A Knockout.

And on proper spa days, you can pop a bit of conditioner on it, and enjoy the subsequent

cashmere softness, safe in the knowledge that you have not only reclaimed a stretch of feminism

that had got lost under the roiling Sea of Bullshit, but will also, over your lifetime, save enough

money from not waxing to bugger off to Finland, and watch the Aurora Borealis from a five-star

hotel whilst shit-faced on vintage brandy.

So yeah. Keep it trimmed, keep it neat, but keep it what it’s supposed to be: an old-skool,

born to rule, hot, right, grown woman’s muff.</blockquote>
