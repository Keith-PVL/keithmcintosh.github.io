# Listen To Mummy! Except When Mummy Is Stupid

Like many small children, our three like to spend the hour after they are put to bed inventing increasingly flimsy and desperate excuses to get up again. They all have FOMO.  Autumn has brought some glorious daytime sunshine and chilly nights (the best) and so some of our cold-weather rituals have begun: porridge for breakfast, hot-water-bottles at bedtime.

They are all sharing one room now and so last night I tucked all three  in with kisses, hot-water-bottles and the usual optimistic/hopeless lecture. Within five minutes,  three year old Pudding was out in the kitchen casually filling a plastic bottle from the water filter.

'What are you doing?' I asked her.

'Yeah, I just take this to bed, Mummy,' she said.

'In what parallel universe?' I spluttered.  There is already at least one wet bed every morning at our place. The washing machine is my constant companion. No way am I letting these kids take half a litre of water to bed!

'No water bottles in bed! Absolutely not!' I said sternly.

'WHAT?' came dual voices from the bedroom.

'I'm telling Pudding she can't take a water bottle to bed!' I called. 'Now go to sleep!"

'But can I keep my water bottle?' came a worried little voice.

'And mine?' piped another.

I was incensed. Were they all stashing bottles of water in their beds? No wonder everybody was pissing themselves! And what else was in there, for gods sake? Mars Bars? Greek salads?

'No water bottles in the beds!' I shouted. 'Bring them out straight away!'

With much indignant muttering, Peanut and T-Bone stomped out to the big room and presented me with their hot water bottles.

'Oh!' I said. 'Oh right! Water bottles. I thought you had **water bottles**. You can have those water bottles.'

Back to bed they went. Just another arbitrary, confusing moment in the arbitrary, confusing landscape that is childhood.
