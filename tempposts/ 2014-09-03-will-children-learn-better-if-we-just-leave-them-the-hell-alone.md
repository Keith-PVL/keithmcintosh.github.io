# Will Children Learn Better If We Just Leave Them The Hell Alone?

## 3rd September 2014

Sugata Mitra won the TEDX prize of a million dollars with his idea of a School In The Cloud. This is his overall plan:

<blockquote>Recruit partners in the areas of technology,   architecture,   education and strategy to help design and build Schools in the Cloud of varying bandwidth and resources. Create the Granny Cloud,   a global network of educators and retired teachers who can support and engage the children through an <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/school-in-the-cloud-sugata-mitra#">online School</a> in the Cloud learning platform. Engage communities, parents, schools and afterschool programs worldwide to transform the way kids learn, by sharing the Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) toolkit with them, along with how-to videos and educational resources.

Our current education system, he says, is arranged around ideas that are 30o years old. Take exams, for instance. We know from cognitive neuroscience that the limbic system, or the part of the brain that processses stress and fear, will shut down the frontal cortex that manages our higher-level thinking, when we feel worried. So why do we have exams, which shut down our brains and then judge how well they work?

It's time for a new paradigm, says Sugata Mitra, and his ideas are fascinating.

This notion has been percolating around my brain ever since.  Set up the circumstances for self-directed learning, and then back away and leave the kids to it. I love it.
