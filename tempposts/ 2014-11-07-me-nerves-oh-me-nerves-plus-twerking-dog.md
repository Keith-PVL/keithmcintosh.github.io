# Me Nerves, Oh Me Nerves (Plus Twerking Dog)

## 7th November 2014

I've been a bit frazzled this last couple of weeks. I nuggested myself on a ziplining adventure course (review to come) and my back and old-lady hip has been giving me curry,   as we say in the old country. Also,   one of my best friends had a sudden breast cancer diagnosis and surgery (all went very well,   she is marvellous and bursting with fuck-cancer life-force), and also,  I lost Pudding in Target for a long enough time that I felt the adrenalin and anxiety fallout for two days.

You know those weeks?

It's all a bit out-of tune?

But things are looking up.

Hark!

Here is a twerking dog!

And also! Eighteen awesomely awkward kisses!

And finally, Keith and I have gotten really into the British comedy Peep Show. It just keeps getting funnier. Mark has so much of the Adrian Mole about him, my favourite literary character. We're loving this.

Spinach, roasted beetroot, chorizo and feta for dinner tonight and tomorrow, I am going to the Blue Mountains to spend the night with my old school friends. We will all need a Bex and a lie down after the intensive coversation-and-cackling festival that will ensue.  I can't wait.

Happy weekend to all of you out there. May it contain old friends, baby spinach, twerking dogs or a combination thereof.
