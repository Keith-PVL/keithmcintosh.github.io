Australian author and 'resilience specialist' Maggie Dent often has a wonderful take on raising kids. Back at school for the term,   I hope all of your little ones are settling in,   thriving and happy. If you have hit a bump in the road though - school refusal, bullying or other worries, Maggie has some excellent advice on how to proceed.

<blockquote>Here’s a six point checklist to help you stay focused and be effective if your child experiences difficulty at school.

**1. Stay calm and rational. **

<br />

It’s natural as a parent to protect, or defend your children, particularly when you think that they’ve come in for some unfair or poor treatment. But acting when you are full of emotion is not always smart. Rather than getting on the phone straight away to organise a meeting at school, take your time to think through how you might assist your child.

**2. Get all the  facts. **

****Once you’ve calmed down, then get the facts about the situation. Kids are faulty observers and often only see one side of a story when there’s a problem with a teacher or a fellow student.They sometimes can’t see that perhaps they may have contributed inadvertently to a dispute at school, or perhaps said something that may have upset a teacher. It’s the job of parents to help kids process what happens in an incident, so that all the facts emerge and understand their place in any problem. Ask good questions to help the full story emerge.

**3. Assess whether to go to school or not**

<br />

Kids, like adults, like to vent and will benefit from having told their side of a story to a trusted source.** **Often problems can be dealt with at home, simply by talking through an issue, and giving kids some common sense tips to help them cope.

If your child has a recurring problem that he can’t solve himself, or you think adult intervention maybe needed to sort out a relationship issue with a teacher or peer, then consider meeting with your child’s teacher or year level coordinator.

**4. Go through the right channels**

****

Approach the school calmly, going through the school office, or directly to your child’s teacher if that is the** usual protocol.** If you have already established a relationship with the teacher concerned, then it’s often easier to approach them directly.

**5. Look for solutions rather than blame**

****

Parent-teacher meetings usually get nowhere when either party blames the other. **State the problem as you see it and view your child’s teacher as an ally, not a foe.** “I’m really worried about Jeremy. He’s been acting strangely lately and I need some help” is the type of approach that will elicit a helpful response. Talk about your concerns and keep the discussion focused firmly on what’s best for your child. Listen to your teacher’s viewpoint, valuing a different perspective.

**6. Stay in touch**

<br />

Be realistic with your expectations, remembering that some problems can’t be solved to your satisfaction, **nor will they be resolved straight away.** Be prepared to work alongside your child’s teacher over the long-term, which means you need to keep communicating with each other.

'Parenting is easy when things are going well,' Dent says, 'but testing when your children struggle or experience difficulty. Stepping back and taking a long-term, reflective view is often the best approach when your child experiences difficulty at school.'</blockquote>

Such clear common-sense advice. I'd only add  'don't charge into the playground, seized with mother-rage,  wildly swinging your handbag to beat random children about the head.' Thank you Maggie!
