Ingredients

<ul>

<li>1kg olive oil</li>

<li>172g caustic soda/lye</li>

<li>250g coconut oil</li>

<li>450ml rain water,   spring water or distilled water</li>

<li>1 oz weight lemon essential oil</li>

<li>2 lemons and 1 orange</li>

</ul>

EQUIPMENT

<ul>

<li>Stainless steel saucepan</li>

<li>Wooden or plastic spoon</li>

<li>Scales - most soap ingredients are measured by weight,   not volume</li>

<li>Jug - for holding oils</li>

<li>Measuring jug - for measuring water. It's ok to measure the water by volume</li>

<li>Thermometer - you can use either a milk or candy thermometer</li>

<li>Stick blender (optional)</li>

<li>Newspaper to cover your work area</li>

</ul>

Process

1. Gather all ingredients and equipment

2. Lay out newspaper over work area

3. Grease silicon mould

2. Measure oils into saucepan,   water into jug and caustic soda into bowl.

3. Zest lemons. I used a fine Microplane / Zester to zest the lemon. Set aside.

4. Weigh the essential oils into a small beaker and set aside.

5.Add lemon and ornage zest to oils and heat slowly in a saucepan with thermometer clipped to the side, until oils reach 50 degrees C.

6. Carefully pour caustic soda into the water and stir gently. (Stand back and be aware of fumes).

7. Check temps between the soda and the oils until both reach at 50 degrees.

8. Carefully pour the soda into the oils, avoiding splashing.

9. With care, use a stick blender until the mixture reaches 'early trace', and becomes stable.  This will be when it thickens, and slight ripples appear on the surface.

10. Add essential oils and mix in until full trace.

11. Pour the mixture into the greased mould.

12. Cover with a towel so it cools slowly.

13. The next day, release from mould and cut into bars.

14. Dry on a rack for 6 weeks, turning every couple of days.

Add lemon zest to fixed oils then warm on the stove or in the microwave. I melted the oils in the microwave.
