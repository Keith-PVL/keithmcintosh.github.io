# Oh Me Nerves

## 30th June 2014

I'm still alive,   yo.

I've got a sinus infection which is taking me back to a dark place of congestion and fear.  And last night, around a campfire, my chair collapsed. One minute I was happily cuddling the T-Bone and  eating garlic prawns, the next I was flat on my back in the dirt with a twenty kilo son on top of me.

I'm OK. Bit sore, but nothing to worry about.  But if you have a history of  <a href="http://mogantosh.com/on-being-a-permanent-patient/">back problems</a>,  my friends of the interwebs, you'll understand the psychic punch of a little accident like that.

It's been a bit of a weird couple of weeks, actually. I was going to write about it tonight, but... me nerves! Oh, me nerves.

Instead, I think I'll give you Lennon and Maisy. They are just damn delightful.

Hope you're all travelling well out there. Tackling the <a href="http://mogantosh.com/on-school-holidays-or-mayday-mayday-the-monkeys-have-destroyed-the-lab/">school holidays</a> with grace and pay-shence. Keeping your bum on your chair.
