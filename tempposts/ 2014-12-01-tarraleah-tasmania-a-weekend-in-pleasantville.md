# Tarraleah, Tasmania: A Weekend In Pleasantville

## 1st December 2014

The family spent the weekend as guests of Tarraleah,   but all opinions are my own.

In the middle of Tasmanian; halfway between Hobart and the wilder west coast draws of Strahan and the Franklin river,   there is a little town called Tarraleah. We stayed there this weekend so I could attend a Christams cooking course at their Widlside Cooking School.

Tarraleah was a bustling hydro-electric town in the 20's and 30's, then a virtual ghost town until it was bought up in 2004 and renovated into a wilderness resort that's hard to describe. It's quirky, and fabulous. It's got resident highland cattle and a Pleasantville-esque string of gorgeously restored 1920's cottages, decorated with teak furniture and built, in our case at the Superintendents Cottage, on a grand scale.

It was a beautiful house to stay in, and judging from the evidence left behind in the eight year olds bedroom, a queen-sized bed to oneself,and a night spent reading Jeffrey Acher short sories while eating sugra packets - I think she would agree that life at Tarraleah is about as good as it gets.

I adored the sun drenched breakfast room. We had such nice weather that there was no chance to use the fireplace, but it's really an Alpine retreat, this place.

A little of the decor. And note to self: arrange face next time.

There is neither mobile phone nor Internet access at Tarraleah village. It all adds to the retro vibe. In fact we all spent some time engrosssed in the 1965 Encyclopeidia Britannica over the fireplace. Cause we know how to party. I was visiting Tarraleah to check out their Wildside Cooking School (more on this tomorrow), but after I finished cooking, we all had a spa in the clifftop hot tub.

It was not, perhaps, as relaxing as it might be for a couple celebrating their anniversary with a bottle of champagne, what with the three small children ut it was still fun.
