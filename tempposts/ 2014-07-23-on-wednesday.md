# On Wednesday

## 23rd July 2014

<div I wrote the passage below a couple of years ago. It talks (whinges? complains? bah humbug semantics!)  about my Wednesday writing day.

<div 

<div I'm still complaing. ,   but reading over

<div 

<div 

<div I still aim for Wednesday as the day where I try to plough through my to-work-on list; although admin and errands often intrude.  A day with no small children can be vital for things like pap smears and waiting around in government offices (if only one could combine the two:  public service think tanx,   take note! )

<div 

<div Still, the useful thing about practicing the dark art of blogging is that it gives you the chance to look back at family moments that would otherwise have gone unrecorded. I read over this and I am washed with a wave of relief- oh my god, I am so lucky not to be juggling three sick children today! Here I am, tapping away  through my to-do-list and there is absolutely no vomit on my hair. (Disclosure: there may be some head lice, but that's a story for another day.)

<div 

<div Yes, sure,  the laundry is a public health hazard. Yes, I can't look at the floor of the toddlers room without despair. Yes, there is Weet-Bix on bowls in the kitchen right now that will never be entirely removed without special blasting equipment.

<div 

<div But we are all well, we are all healthy, and part of the reason that the house is in such a state is that at the end of the day, I would rather watch Masterchef and read books in the bath than spend my few hours off-duty scrubbing floors.  It's bloody hard work cooking, cleaning, chauffeuring and trying to create a loving and nurturing home life. It's hard yards.  Every once ina while - before a party, say, a couple of hard core days will bring the place up to tip-top shape, and the hour that tidy house lasts for is immensely gratifying. But to manage that every day? It's impossible for me. And Keith's business is a start-up - he works all the time he can, and he is super-dad all the rest of the time. He'd rather spend his time off giving Ivy piano lessons that sweeping dust bunnies too. There's only so much time in the day for all the things.

<div 

<div Anyway, this old Wednesday post was a reminder for me that life's good, and nobody is vomiting.

<div 

<div Hurrah!

<blockquote>

<div For a brief, glorious period, I have been setting aside Wednesdays as my writing day, with Ivy at school, Ted at pre-school and Georgie at family day-care.  It requires an intense morning wrangling all five of us out of the house for the day: washed, dressed, breakfasted and loaded with lunch and homework folders and assorted paraphernalia depending on age and continence ability. (If Keith forgets his Pull-Ups it can make for an awkward video Skype with scientists in Germany.)

<div 

The triple drop-off completed, I head to the coffee shop and the library for caffeine and a few wonderful, quiet, focused hours, before the end of the school day calls and it's time to do the pick-up in reverse order. Then we crack through Wednesday afternoon:  music lessons, soccer training,  homework, housework, dinner prep and the general management of overwrought, post-institutionalised children (mainly through the judicious application of porridge, ABC2 and Mum's lap.)



Wednesdays are busy, but those hours I spend alone in the middle; out of the house and tinkering with words,  fill a important need for me. They drop me back into myself. They allow me space to think a thought through to its conclusion. They fuel me for the following week of trying to respond to the needs of others, and grabbing moments to myself in between tasks.



Alas. It's been a while.



Today, Ivy barked her way through a doctors visit where they diagnosed her with laryngitis. As the doctor listened to her chest, and her breathing rattled theatrically and satisfyingly, she grinned with pride. She's next to me now, making lists of things to research on YouTube and asking me every five minutes 'Are you finished on the computer yet? Are you finished yet?'



It's not as peaceful as my coffee shop.



Last week, the vomiting seemed finally to have finished. The last lot of defiled linens were drying in the sun, and I was desperately looking forward to a Wednesday on my own. But nay. The water heater broke down, and I had to spend the morning with a plumber who followed me around the house explaining how Hitler had invented an engine that displaced space so that objects could move faster than time, thus flying to the moon and also building the pyramids. He had seen UFO's from his house in Engadine, so he was definitely not mistaken.



It was not  as peaceful as my coffee shop.



The preceding two Wednesdays had been spent cuddling miserable children and washing gastric juices out of my hair. That was not peaceful. Before that, my school holiday Wednesday may have been fun, and may have been packed with togetherness and good times and the general Making of Memories, but it was definitely, absolutely, without question, not as peaceful as my coffee shop.



Next week.



Please.</blockquote>
