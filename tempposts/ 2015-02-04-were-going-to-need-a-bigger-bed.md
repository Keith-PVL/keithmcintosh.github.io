# We're Going To Need A Bigger Bed

Small children do not have the deep and passionate attachment to their beds that we adults do. (Especially,   we adult parents of those small children,   who get to spend much less quality time with our soft, inviting beds than we would like.) Nope, kids resist going to bed, they are up and out of it at the crack of dawn, and they prefer to sleep, whenever possible, in somebody else’s bed. And the best bed of all is that big, warm, comfy one occupied by Mum and Dad.

Every night one, two or all three of our children end up in the parental bed. Before that they call out once or twice for assistance with nightmares or lost blankets. Also, we’re night training two of them which, when successful, means midnight toilet runs, and when unsuccessful, requires midnight sheet-changing. Sometimes twice. Sometimes three times. Sometimes four. Up and down the hall Keith and I stagger, using the complex and nuanced turn-taking system known as ‘marriage’.

The kids sneak into our bed like stealth ninjas in order to bypass the ‘not before the sun is up’ rule. Sometimes they wee in our bed too, for a change of pace. On the upside, there’s probably a delightful warm waterfall aspect to my dreams, initially, but by the time I wake up, it’s an awfully cold puddle.

The children arrange themselves in torturous poses and although they only weigh twenty kilos, they may as well be made of lead for all the difficulty we have moving them from positions like The Starfish and The Diagonal Spasming Pony-Kicker. Many mornings, I wake wedged into a corner, neck forced into an unnatural curve,  circulation cut off by the dead weight resting on my legs, a cold, wet patch underneath me and a toddler poking me in the eye. ‘Dretfast,’ she says. ‘Get up and make my dretfast Mama.’

The kids see me as a walking pantry and start demanding food as soon as their eyes open, but they see Keith and start making him play games. They sit on him and try and get him do the one where he turns into an angry woman if they pull his ears. This is all well and good, but when we’ve been up half the night holding little bottoms over toilets and encouraging action with ‘Pssssssssssssssss’ like second-rate Play School presenters, it’s hard to drag our middle-aged carcasses out of bed, opening up the short-order kitchen and the improvisational theatre.

And yet. Complaints aside, the loveliness of having the family all in one bed outweighs the crappy parts, many times over. Kids have no sense of personal space from Mum and Dad, and they are filled with pure and intense love, which expresses itself in warm, unbridled affection. It is like a warm bath for the spirit to have a small person, frisky and loving as a puppy, wind their perfect, smooth, warm little limbs around you and say ‘I love you so, so much Mummy.’ Even if they do follow that up with ‘Now get me my dretfast.’ There’s only one solution that I can see: we’re going to need a bigger bed.
