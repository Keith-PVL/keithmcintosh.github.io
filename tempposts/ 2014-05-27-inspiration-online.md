# Inspiration Online

## 27th May 2014

I'm feeling inspired by two creative,   thoughtful mothers today. Amanda from Soulemama posted <a href="http://www.soulemama.com/">these amazing pictures</a> of the house her nine-year old daughter built as a present for her three-year old sister. It made me think about how to encourage my kids to do more making,   and to think about what would make their siblings happy.

Then Kate from Fox's Lane wrote <a href="http://foxslane.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/fire-feast-and-song.html#.U4QF6_mSyos">this gorgeous post </a>about an afternoon spent around a bonfire with her three daughters.

<blockquote>And it occurred to me as I sat up against my farmer boy watching their glowing faces and listening to their songs that finally after years and years and years of entertaining them with nursery rhymes and silly games,   that they are finally entertaining us. And I felt blessed beyond measure.</blockquote>

Both of these posts made me think about the ways in which we spend time as parents setting boundaries, enforcing habits and creating rituals. We hold firm on what we feel is important (something that looks different for every family), as we prepare them for this hazy idea of what of their grown-up lives might be.

Of course life doesn't ever turn out exactly as planned or imagined, but Amanda has always encouraged her children to be creative and to show love to each other, and that has resulted in an obvious and lovely sisterly bond; in empathy, and in an  ability to think about service to others. Kate, too,  has surrounded her kids with creativity and music, and as they grow up, that has clearly become part of their intrinsic make-up.

I find it inspiring.

Happy Tuesday.
