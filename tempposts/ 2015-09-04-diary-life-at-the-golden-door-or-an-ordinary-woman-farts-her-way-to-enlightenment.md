# Diary: Life at The Golden Door (OR: An Ordinary Woman Farts Her Way to Enlightenment)

## 4th September 2015

Hola,   my comrades!

Sorry for the radio silence. My laptop kicked the bucket,   but is home from the techno-hospital now.

While I was on my e-sabbatical, news.com published my <a href="http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/the-hilarious-diary-of-a-mum-on-a-health-retreat/story-e6frfqe0-1227501741618">diary of life at the Golden Door.Â </a>

Short version: caffeine withdrawal, terrible fartiness, sudden embarrassing tears, and overall, a brutal re-integration to Mum Life.

You can read the long version <a href="http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/the-hilarious-diary-of-a-mum-on-a-health-retreat/story-e6frfqe0-1227501741618">here</a>, if you like.

I'll be back on Monday to chat more - I've been decluttering all my cupboards, reading true crime and thinking about 'period feminism'... Oh my god, it's sure to be fabulous! Or the other one - pointless and shit? Yeah, totally shit!

ps: 8 year old just popped out of bed to deliver me the lyrics she's been writing out to 'Greased Lightning."

As follows:

**Go greece lightening your burning up the coal mine**

**Greece lightening go greece lightening**

**Go greece lightening your burning up the greece inside**

**Greece lightening go greece lightening**

**You are supreme**

**The chicks are cream**

**Greece lightening**

And now, I die happy.
