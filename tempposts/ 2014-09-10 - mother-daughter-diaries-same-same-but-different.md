# Mother Daughter Diaries: Same Same, But Different

## 10th September 2014

*Ivys diary: Today we went to Nanna’s house. We did knitting and Teddy went to his first rugby game. Now Nanna is trying to fix a hat. Soon she might make some Milo nummy nummy. Now we are watching the boring Play School. It was  a great day.*

 

*Then,   quote from my seven year old diary (photo Instagram) *

*Link to the radiotopia 99% podcast where they followed up on the teenage diaries they recorded 16 years before. *
