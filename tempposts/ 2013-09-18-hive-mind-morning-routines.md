# Hive Mind: Morning Routines

## 18th September 2013

Welcome to the first post of my Hive Mind series.

In this series,   I want to explore different areas of parenting and domestic life by harnessing the smarts of this interesting  and thoughtful blogging community. Each post will feature advice and ideas from a couple of intelligent contributors, and I hope that readers will also share their ideas on how they handle the issue of the day.

Today, we are exploring morning routines. Now, I don't know what mornings look like at your place, but I have three kids under seven and I like to stay in bed squeezing my eyes shut and pretending I am in Cap D'Antibes for as long as possible. If I am up, it's because I have dragged my sorry ass out of bed early to work on my book, not on breakfast. These habits does not make for peaceful before-school routines.  Just recently we had such a stressful morning that I had to listen, heart filled with shame, to the baby saying 'Fock! Fock! Fock!' in the car on the way to daycare.

Clearly I need help.

Today I have called in a couple of learned expertisetresses to tackle the issue.

Bron, mum of three, writes the funny and thoughtful <a href="http://maxabellaloves.blogspot.com.au/">Maxabella Loves</a>. She is so very organised that she has trademarked her system: the Maxabellaland <a href="http://maxabellaloves.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/maxabellaland-morning-routine-for.html">Morning Routine for Working Parents</a><sup>TM</sup> (MMRWP). It is extremely impressive (especially the part where Bron prevents her husband from implementing a waking-kids technique he picked up on Wife Swap USA.) The MMRWP  revolves around a highly organised leather-couch mothership, which contain everything she needs to clothe and groom her three before school (including the shoes, dear god, the shoes, always the shoes.)

''I've got three top  tips for stress-free mornings,' Bron says. 'Get everything ready and laid out the night before - including my own stuff, no screens until after breakfast and the kids are dressed for school with their teeth brushed and hair combed, and sit down for a proper 'family' (minus husbie!) breakfast.'

'However demanding school is,' says Jodi from <a href="http://cheandfidel.blogspot.com/">Che and Fidel</a>, 'it does provide some beautiful lessons, mostly for me and **my** rhythm. ' Jodi's blog describes her mission to live a simple, creative and peaceful life, and her <a href="http://cheandfidel.blogspot.com/2013/03/routines-rhythm.html">morning routine,  </a> which involves getting her boy off to school while tending to a toddler, reflects her focus on calm and serenity.  It includes Thursday night pizza (with leftovers for Friday lunch), checking there is a clean uniform the night before and setting the alarm early to begin preparation in the quiet stillness.

'I just try my best not to yell "hurry up", says Jodi. 'When I do, I find it's a damn awful start to the day. I remind myself that I'm just trying to get them to school...it doesn't really matter if we're ten minutes late. A bit of perspective helps.'In fact, the key to a smooth morning, Jodi says, is a good <a href="http://cheandfidel.blogspot.com/2013/08/bedtime.html">bedtime routine. </a> Lights out before ten is her aim. 'The benefits of a bedtime are plentiful, but most pleasing is the way I feel the next day,' says Jodi. 'I'm energised and happy, I work more productively and respond to situations instead of reacting to them. Creating a bedtime for myself is one of the best things I've done for my wellbeing.'



My favourite takeaways from these smart cookies: Getting organised the night before (and off to bed early),  Thursday night pizza (Friday lunch sorted), and a family sit-down breakfast.  I am hoping to improve our early mornings with a little of Bron's precision and a little of Jodi's calm. No more swearing babies for me! (I like to set the bar quite low.)What about you, dear reader? How do you handle the mornings at your place? Are you all over the place like a madwoman's shit? Do you have a routine that works? And for the love of God, how do you manage the shoes? Leave your ideas in the comments below, and thanks to Bron and Jodi for sharing their systems.
