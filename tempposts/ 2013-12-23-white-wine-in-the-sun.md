# White Wine In The Sun

## 23rd December 2013

Are you hosting Christmas at your place this year?

Yes?

I salute you.

How are you doing all the crazy Christmas prep and still keeping your house guest-ready? My place looks like a glitter bomb went off. It would be demoralising if I had a minute to think about it. I think it feels worse because I'm sick right now,   I'm SO TIRED,   so I'm lumping about the place like a wet blanket, muttering lists, and I tell you, if I had five bucks for every time I've said '**ah,** **fe**r** fucksake**' I would not have blown my Christmas budget.

I definitely need a break in the weather. Some down-time to reboot the system. And perhaps, mop the floor.

Tomorrow Keith stops work for a bit, and we're looking forward to some screen-free time. No little blinking  blue lights for a while. Rather, books and couches and pianos and sandy feet and maybe a campfire or two.

It's been a big year. My plan is to return to you in a week or so with a nicely adjusted attitude.

Happy Christmas to you and yours! May your days be merry and bright. x

Here's Tim Minchin.
