# The Food As Medicine Bandwagon and The Dangeous Lure of Woo Woo

## 17th March 2015

sensible to turn a sceptical eye at the modern diet - gmo,   the self-interest of corporations,   etc. Many peope try to purchase fair trde,   organixs, sustainable food with animal weelfare in mind. Its the fringes. The fringes combined with the power of social media.

Dr Joanna McMiollan (via The Glow website): **The concern however with this ‘Paleo formula’ is the quantity of liver and the frequency it would be fed to the baby. Consider that half a cooked chicken liver (about 10g) contains almost double the upper limit recommended for vitamin A for an infant aged 6-12 months. Lamb liver is even higher with the same quantity providing 4.5 times what is considered the safe upper limit. You can see that while a small quantity of liver once or twice a week as part of a mixed meal might be a wonderful nutrient boost, drinking a liver-rich broth daily could be extremely dangerous. Amongst other problems, chronic vitamin A toxicity can cause bone abnormalities. Interestingly these have been <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v296/n5854/abs/296248a0.html" target="_blank">found in fossil remains of early humans</a> and thought to be due to too much vitamin A.**

People. Are. Dying.

I realy like the Paleo Everyday cookbook. But itis incredible arrogance - dangerous hubris - to take the risj with an infants health because you have devded that your ideas on health - with your four-week qualiification from a gealtyh institure - carry more wieght that (list the groups that banded together to have the book unplublished).

The fact is that these people don't have skin in the game, unliek Evans (list inta and FB followers). who is at the helm of a fast-growing cookbook and speaking tour empire.

Basically he has fallen for the what blogger Pip Lincolne calls the 'like cycle' - he's

Food as food. Medicine as medicine. Believe in one at the expense of the other? Only if you are a Messianic asshole with delusions of grandeur.

But it;s incredible arraigance to take the risk of an

Back in  the seventeenth century the Enlightenment period was an age that valued scientific enquiery and rationalism. It was followed by the Romantics. It's so much easier for we humans to take things on faith. ...

Evidence-based science isn't perfect - like democracy - but it's  the best option we have.

In the middle of the road, where most of us operate, there is much value to be found in questioing held wisdoms - the value 'food pyramid' , for example, and the growing understanding of how much gut health can affect us...but at the edges, thats where the crazies congregate, and social media means there is so much love-potential for those with a Messianic bent.

Like Pete Evans, for example.

I've got nothing against the way he activates his almonds. I think much of the Paleo diet is great. and I can see that it's a very seductive diet for those with an obsessive personality, a signifigant level of self-obsession an a lot of time on their hands. Cut processed food out, sure. Minimise gluten and diary even. But the committed Paleo-phile is required to spend hours in the kitchen fermenting, preparing and  activating their food. Also, the cost of a small country on purchasing organic, pature fed and sustainably. It doesn't have to be hand-rolled on the hips of fair-trade Peruvian , but it helps.

You know that old saying 'every generation thinks they discoevered sex and coffee'? Well, it apples to food fads too. The Kellogs stuff of the 19th centure, the Isralia diet, Pritikin food-combining, Macrobiotics, juice-cleansing, etc.

Really it's just trendy. That's the pull. If the Paleo diet was a person it would have a full-sleeve tattoo of Rosie The Riveter and a fresh, light tan. It would have surf-waves and

The difference with Paloe thing is that it has arrived in this era when evidence-based science has become suspicious and pseudo-scienceis rife - everywhere, like

The fact that the modern Western diet is unhealthy is not new. Michael Pollan decribes how best to change that in his famous adviec:  'Eat less. Mostly plants.'
