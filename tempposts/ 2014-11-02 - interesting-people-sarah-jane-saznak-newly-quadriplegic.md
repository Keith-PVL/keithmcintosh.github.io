# Interesting People: Sarah-Jane Saznak, Newly Quadriplegic

## 2nd Whoops 2014

In November of 2013,   Sarah-Jane Saznak underwent surgery to repair a bulging disc in her neck. She awoke from that surgery a quadriplegic,   and has spent the last year in intensive rehabilitation,   coping with both the physical and the emotional aftermath of what has happened to her.

Meet SJ. She's pretty amazing.

*SJ,  you have done some really incredible stuff, like cycling around Australia, ** South America and various parts of the world, as well as working as a Cross Country  **Skiing, Rock Climbing and Canyoning Instructor. Let’s just say that you have not **been a couch potato. Can you tell us a story from one of your adventures? ** What was the biggest challenge you faced in life before this massive bastard you’re **dealing with now?*

Towards the end of my eighteen-month long cycling journey around Australia ( w did a Figure 8 on a pushy), I was heading up t Cape York on a rough corrugated road full of dust in a bad headwind.We’d been on the road for sixteen months, it was so hot and it was so challenging to put  one foot in front of the other to reach the tip of Australia. I kept plugging away but I was spent. My prtmer was way ahead and it was, I think, the first time in my life I just lost it. I remember I threw my bike down on the ground and ran off into the bush and screamed with exhaustion.

**If  it’s not too painful to talk about, what do you remember about waking from the surgery? Did it take some time to understand or believe what had happened to you?**

I woke up to hear the voice of this little registrar saying 'The surgery went well'. And then he was getting me to wiggle my toes and then I couldn't sit up. He had no manner appropriate for the moment, and I started to panic and he started saying shit like 'On wow, this is bad, I haven't seen this before...'  And then I ended up in emergency with a massive hemorrhage in my spinal cord.

After that I have very little recollection. I had so many anxiety attacks in that period - I thought I had some expoerience with anxiety but they were different - really, really intense. In those first few weeks I was in a bit of denial – I was happy, really connected with staff and had really intimate r/ships with the staff, and I was pumped full of steroids, and I kept thinking 'Once thes steroids kick in, it will be fine...'  But as it becme a reality, it was tough. They tell you these benchmarks: after  3 weeks, this. After 6 weeks, this. Each time you reach one it's terrible. I was  basket-case really.  It's all a it of a blur.

**A year on, do you feel that your shock and grief is at a different stage? **

Grief is right. I have times I struggle with 'I'm never going to ski again - I love to dance, and I'm never going to dance again.' I suppose I've gone through all the stages of grief.  I even became quite close to the surgeon, in the early days and weeks. In one encounter we both cried and I told him 'You have to let this go'. I  understand that shit happens. I ahven't seen him for some time and I'm advised not to have contact with him now though.

**SJ, you had an extremely active life before that surgery. Do you think that your fitness has stood you in good stead for the rigours of rehabilitation?**

Its beginning to. Really, I've spent the majority of this year dealing my with mental health.  It's a year next week since my surgery, and I'm starting  to reach a place where I can get my head in the place where I can tap into that. Now I can feel my body kicking back in. At the minute I am working on a stationery bike. I lie there and talk to my legs, tell them 'Come on, you’ve done this, you know what to do’.

**4. Are you a person that relies on black humour? Have you ever, in all the stress, had those ridiculous moments where you just have to laugh?**

Oh my god yes, definitely. I don't know so much about having to laugh, but  I remember there was one time when they moved me from my room to one room down and I was lying in bed and the buzzer had dropped to the ground. I was completely unable to move and I couldn't call out becase at that time I couldn't breathe well,and I had all these sinus problems. And I told myself 'OK, I can either have an anxiety attack, or  stay calm, and just accept this moment.'

I mean, I've has so many bowel accidents that in the end I have to laugh. At the start I cried,  but now I have to laugh, or I'd  be a basket case.

**6. Sometimes people talk about a ray of sunshine in the shit where, when faced with trauma and struggle, you realise what love and support you have around you? Have you experienced that?**

Oh my god, yes. In a less broken phase I used to think 'At the end of all this there's a big gold nugget'. Now what I have to keep reminding myself is that there are little gold nuggets along the way. . For example, I've always thought that my Dad is a wonderful man, but he's been so compassionate and amazing. Plus, I live in the most amazing community – so helpful, so kind. I've always been really social, and I feel like I've been a bit of a magnet to bring people together, so it's kind of come to bite me on the arse in the best possible way! But I am having to learn to receive and receive and not give back, which is one of the hardest things for me. But  I don't have any choice at the moment.

** SJ, you've got a 5 year old son, Hamish. How have you coped with the busy emotional intensity of mothering a small child along with all the huge psychological life-shift you’ve had to undertake?   How has Hamish coped? **

Oh, it's been tough. Me and Hamish's dad separated a week before  the surgery, and Hamish and I had such a special relationship, he was so close to his Mum. I was his person. But after 7 months in rehab I felt like I came home as a stranger into my own home. Instead of 'Mum, canI...?' it's 'Dad, Dad, Dad'. The loss of that mother role, and the grief of losing that relationship that we had, and having to reestablish a relationship ship that’s not the same, and having to accept that it will never be the same, and stop grieving for what it could be - that's probably the hardest part about it.

But Hamish is the most gorgeous 5 year old. Sometimes I'll melt down in front of him – and I'm  upfront with him about stuff -  and he's so 's helpful, he'll help with my catheter bag or push my wheelchair. He's becomes a lot more independent. Now, he can sit on y lap in the electric chair and I can take him to school, which I love. That's what I really want to be able to do, stuff like take him to school.

**SJ you have a fundraiding page that is helping to to get enough money to go to America for therapty and to buy equipment that you need.  Can you tell us a little about the therapy, tools and equipment you are hoping to raise funds for? And how can people help you raise those funds? **

I need equilemt that’s specialised , id like to be able to do more cardo – my body and mental healkth is so much better whebn im being acxive, im going to need to set up my opwn rehab gfym.

Its expensive.  like weddings – if youre trying to get equipment its so much more expewncse than anything else. Im having to do this intensice program, and ive decided in the l;ast moth of 2, even though its traumatic  to leave my son anagain, the big pictyre is to get as good as I can get to be more funational as a parent. And also, I want him to see and remember that his mum and be proud of his mum and how string she ws and how hard she thought.

I want to be able to do basci stuff like take my kid to school.

 

All I want to be

Link to funraidug page – is SJ happy for me tocut and paste photos from that page? Also the party in November.

 

 

This phone conversation I had with SJ is one of life's 'little gold nuggets' for me.
