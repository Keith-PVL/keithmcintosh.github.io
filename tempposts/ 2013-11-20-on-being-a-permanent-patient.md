# On Being A Permanent Patient

## 20th November 2013

I woke up this morning with the full weight of a sturdy toddler on top of me. Beside me, seven year-old Peanut was curled up so close that her hair was in my half-open, sleep-of-the-dead, dribbling mouth. When I unfolded my limbs to get up, there was probably some audible creaking, although my ears are too blocked to hear it

Settle in for some tiny violins, dear readers. A whinge-festival is looming.

In the early hours of this morning, two-year-old Pudding had an attack of a sort of coughing-demanding illness.

Hack hack hack.

I need milky!

Hack hack hack.

Where my nummy! Purple nummy! No pink nummy!

Hack.

Milky finished. More milky!

Hack hack.

Need Gogo. Where my puppy!  Geddit Mummy.

Hack hack.

Geddit Mummy!

Hack.

Geddit!

At some point, the K-Dog crawled out to sleep in an empty bunk bed, and Pudding and I passed out. When I woke up in that terrible position, spreadeagle-squashed under a well-padded baby, I levered myself out of bed, my back as stiff as a young mans...resolve, and I was mad. Mad and resigned and sad and a bit broken.

See, my back pain has been really good lately. It's not always been the case. Here, an abbreviated back-story I wrote a few years ago:

<blockquote> My bad back has been a defining aspect of my life since age seventeen, when I was trying on a a beatnik minidress in a boutique called Wheels and Doll Baby and Mum said 'Why is your hip sticking out like that?'

Scoliosis. Mucho curvature of the spine.

Cue spinal fusion 1, where surgeons removed a rib, turned it into bionic glue and used it to fuse three vertabrae together, securing them with rods and bolts. Months in a brace, painted with hippy slogans and psychedelic cartoons.

On with life.

Cue spinal fusion 2, a couple of years later, after a broken screw and a lot of pain. Hip graft, more screws, a another rod, one more level fused. Another brace. Less optimistic artwork.

On with life.

Cue freak boating accident a couple of years later. Fibreglass floor meets fused spine at high velocity. Vertabrae under fusion snaps.

Life gets ugly. A year in bed, hepped up on on horse-tranquillizers takes its toll on my relationship, my friendships, my hopes for the future. Pain and depression haunt me with their tiny violins.

Ten years later: A beautiful partner, a baby, a happy life, one I feared would never happen. Pain isn't my constant house-guest any more, but it visits me a lot, leaving a mess, pissing off the other residents, taking advantage.

Marriage is a finely tuned symphony of negotiation. You win one, you lose one, you scratch a back, you get an itch of your own met. You both give in, give in, give in. Whats affects one, affects all. You can't live the selfish, delightful life of the committment-phobe that Keith and I both perfected before we gave in to Big Love.

My main struggle, when I'm in pain, is to stay positive. When the body hurts, it's a fight to keep the machine running - cook this, wash that, play with this one, feed the other. And do it all with a smile. So much emotional energy is going into keeping the essentials on track, there's not much left for fun, or laughter, or affection.</blockquote>

Lately, my back has been better than it has in years. I'm going to the gym, I'm doing yoga, and Pudding is big enough that I carry her much less, and I hardly ever haul a stroller around. This is so fantastic.

But here's the kicker: moving in smoothly to fill the vacuum where back pain used to live has been chronic sinusitis, a new and interesting animal, and by 'interesting' you should infer 'total bastard'.  My face is hurting all the time, to varying degrees. The pressure is like a tightening clamp on my head, my throat gets sore, I am often nauseous, I've have almost entirely lost my sense of smell, and my ears seem to be getting more blocked. It's like being separated from the world by a thin film.

I'm 2 rounds of antibiotics in, and the CT scans show problems of the 'entirely-solid-where -it-should-not-be-so' variety but it's another two months until my appointment with an ENT. In the meantime, I'm using a neti pot and doing oil-pulling and taking vitamins and all that crap, but mainly, I'm living back in the headspace of managing family life while in pain. It is tough. Pain is so isolating.

It's hard to connect with another person when there is a whole secret subtext going on, distracting and separating you from intimacy.  It involves a juggle between trying to be stoic, not complain, to deny the pain its power; and then the human need to whinge and offload and share what is actually happening. Managing pain takes energy, energy that I need to be a happy wife and mama and friend and writer.

On the weekend I said to Keith: 'Just so you know, my face is really sore today. I don't want to talk about it, but I want you to know this is happening, so that if I am distant or weird, you know why.'

So when I woke up with a sore back today, and staggered into the kitchen to make breakfast with a throbbing face, I felt exhausted by it. I'm still mad. Stupid body. Stupid body doing stupid, stupid things. If you're out there with a stupid body being a dickhead to you, I send my sympathy. And if you have any tips on sinusitus, I'd love to hear them.

With that, I'll pack away my little violin, and get onto the next job on my list, which reads: try not to whinge.

Thanks for listening.
