# Martha Stewart's Food Photography Is Disgusting

## 8th January 2014

This story made me laugh so hard.

Lifestyle goddess/insider trader Martha Stewart has been catching some flak on the wires for her hilariously bad food tweets. She appears to be employing some kind of anti-filter to make everything she photographs look inedible.

Jesus Christ,   Martha, says one commenter.  The fuck is that.

Others agree. That soup pic looks like a toilet bowl after an attack of intestinal flu. Just try looking at this for more than three seconds without spewing. That looks like a present from my dog.

Martha, of course, is regal and unapologetic.

Link via <a href="How do you handle the relentless, never-ending tide of housework, psychologically? Do you ever feel like you might actually, literally, lose your shit?   Are you a systems person? How does your system work?  Are you a wild shouter or a muttering witch when it all becomes too much?   How much does your family divide the load of housework with you?   What is your secret filthy shame?  Linen cupboard? Third drawer down? Bottom of the wardrobe?   You have a beautiful house, gorgeously styled, Beth. It's like homestead porn. Is this really a brilliant illusion that you have created while you type maniacally at your laptop in a dingy shed like the Unabomber? Just asking.   1. You have to treat the relentless, mundane, soul destroying work as something that JUST HAS TO BE DONE. Like going to the bathroom, or going to sleep, drinking water, this shit just needs to get done. You have to tackle in bursts, and NEVER, I repeat NEVER stop half way. Set yourself a quick 15 min window with a few goals in it: for me I can get all the beds made, dishy packed and breakfast cleaned up in 15 mins. 15 mins never killed anyone did it? Go like the clappers - a cleaning whirling durvish if you will - and then reward yourself and do nothing for a few hours. I tackle washing like this...anyone household task. You will note though, that I am mental. And OF COURSE I occasionally think I will lose my shit if a knife with vegemite is placed on the sink rather than the dishwasher for the 675th time. I'm only human, even though I may have super neat powers.  2. I am a wild shouter. I have learnt over the past 12 months or so to give warnings to all members of my family that I am nearing shout mode. So I suppose I am a creeping wild shouter. It goes a bit like this: &quot;Daisy you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 7 minutes. Daisy you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 5 minutes. Daisy and Harper you are not listening to me, you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 4 minutes. If you don't start to get dressed, I am going to get cranky and I am going to shout at you both. GET DRESSED.&quot; I also swear when I am shouty. It's not good I know, but I do it. They know I am serious when the swearing begins.   3. I do ALL OF THE THINGS. Namely because I am a control freak who likes things done PROPERLY (aka my way). It's a ridiculous way to tackle things which mean that I spend a lot of time doing ALL OF THE THINGS but it's my own issue and I will deal with it/punish myself by doing ALL OF THE THINGS.  4.Dude! I have SO many dirty secrets. But my worst? Cupboard Management. Open any cupboard in my house and you will see shit spilling from it. I have a friend who was SHOCKED with the state of all my cupboards. If it has doors and can be shut then I don't care what happens in there. I need to work on this, except then I remember that I have a life and really cannot be fucked. I think I need to live in an open shelved house.  5. My house actually looks like it does on the blog and Instagram ALL THE TIME. As I said, I'm mental. I like clean and neat for my state ofmind - always have since I was a girl - and it's not going to change. Of course mess comes with life and we have kids, lots of visitors and entertaining so of course mess is around at times but dead set, it's usually like this. Ask any of my friends or family...just don't open the cupboards!!!  Link away to any big issue post - just search for them on the blog under the big issues tab on the side. The videos are in my media page as well. If you need anything else, just let me know!">Tori </a>(whose food photography, like her food, is beautiful).
