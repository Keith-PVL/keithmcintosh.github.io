# A Walking, Eating Tour Of Hobart Town

## 10th December 2014

**Disclosure: I attended this walking tour as a guest of Gourmania,   but all opinions are my own. **

If you are a foodie, as I am, and a mother, as I am, and currently on an extended stay with the family in Tasmania, as I am, then you understand the joy I felt in my heart when I trotted off last week to join a child-free food safari of downtown Hobart.

Freeeeeeee!

This is Mary.

Good face, yes? Mary is the owner and inventor of Gourmania, a walking-tour company that takes small groups around Hobart. A former pastrychef and  a native Tasmanian, Mary is full of tales that bring the locavore Tasmanaian food scene to life. She knows all the producers and retailers by name, and her passion for Tasmanian produce is infectious. Listening in as she chats to the butcher or the winemaker is like being ringside for some sort of live 'in-conversation' event about food: seriously fun, if you like that sort of thing.

Factoring in food alergies and dislikes with charm, Mary

Armed with bottles of Cape Brim water (from the cleanest source on the planet, Mary tell us) our small group in sensible shoes starts the tour at Tassal Salmon, where we taste three varieties of Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon farmed in freshwater tanks- the industry that saved the Huon Valeey  economy when the apple industry collapsed. Thanks for all the fish, indeed.

The salmon: gorgeous. And almost impossible to buy here - it all gets imported to China!

Next stop was the Wursthaus Kitchen: charcurterie-lovers dream, and vegans nightmare. This store, with in-house butcher, features unusual and high quality cuts of meat as well as cheeses.

We tasted the most amazing Australian wagyu beef from Robbin Island  (up near Cape Grim of the 'clean water' fame). The beef cattle live on an isthmus and are grass fed on sand dune vegetation between to pristine white-sand islands in the far northwest coast. The beef is marbled and meltingly delicious. We didn't try the wallaby - an 'acquired taste', Mary says carefully.

We tasted some cheese, including a raclette that recently won Best Cheese in Australia. Shamefully, I cannot read the name of it. This may have been the point where I started dribbling on my notes?

Next stop,, Jackman and Ross Bakery, who win my heart forever with their automatic double-shot policy, and then onto Takagi Sushi, where the sushi is lovely and fresh, but my stomach contents are starting perhaps to fight a little with each other. It's time to undo my top button. Not to worry: walk it off! Past the funky Criterion Street and into Cool Wine, where it's time to taste a selection of Tasmanian wines. Mary is impressive again at the wine shop. 'Stewed pear, is it?' she muses with the owner. 'I'm almost getting a  sweet candy at the end.' I nod in agreement. 'Very...drinkable,',  I offer limply. I enjoy myself sniffing and inspecting the glass like a proper grown-up. The wines are good, and so are the stories of eccentric winemakers.

We're revived for the trip to Spice World, a Hobart institution where we have another pastry and sniff some lovely evocative boxes and eat a goos cinnamon scroll - not too sweet; perfect.

I's hard to keep up with Mary at times. 'Best poached eggs in Hobart!'she throws off as we pass Betsey. I'm trying to remeber where we are, but I'm full of wine and pastry and it's hard to k

Then, the Brunuswick St Hotel, which strarted life as a sly grog shop in 1832, but was a rundown old lady until its renovation by three Melbourne biys four years ago.The renovation is goregous, all 30's lead-lights and convict brickwork. We tasted a Pirates Bay calamari and chorizo dish; served with more great stories about the provenance of the food.

Altogether, this tour gave a real life to the sense I have of the Tssmanian food industray. beloved and cosseted liek a family member, its producers and salespeople have a feirce and passionaye attachem,tn to their insutrey.

 

Brunswick St Hotal

Last stop: Smolt for ice cream

If you love a bit of history with your ood, and own a pair of senible shoes, then the Gormani Walking Tour is a fantatsic way to spend a moprning in Hobart.
