# Kid's Brains And 'Back To School' Stress: How To Help Children Feel Calmer

## 30th January 2014

Some great advice from <a href="http://www.maggiedent.com/">Maggie Dent</a>:

<blockquote>As children start heading back to school this week may I remind you that this is a 'change' experience and change causes everyone to feel a little anxious,   fearful or uncertain. Those children starting new schools will experience this the most. This stress will cause cortisol increases - the stress brain chemical and for some children this will influence behaviour! As they settle over the next few weeks, make time to help their stressed brains make the positive neurotransmitters - serotonin, dopamine and endorphins - lots of reassuring safe touch, have fun, bake familiar favourite foods, lighten things around home by wearing the odd tiara, fake teeth, super hero cape or weird wig! Yes,  avoid 'in - depth' interrogations in the car 'how was school?' They will often share spontaneously after dinner, a bath or at bed time....... and yes help them get organized the night before so the morning dash, is a little calmer. For our adolescents - the stress levels are much higher due to puberty hormones and brain pruning and they are highest for students who have no friends to make the journey easier. Maybe ask them ''how can I support you for the next month as you settle?' I wish you all a positive schooling experience this year and I hope your child gets a teacher who loves his/her job!
