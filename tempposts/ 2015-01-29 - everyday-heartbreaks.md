# Everyday Heartbreaks

## 29th January 2015

1. Losing your new summer shorts just before getting your legs waxed and finding them again 3 weeks later,   thus missing the only period of the summer in which you could have walked around proudly  like 'woman' rather than 'yeti'.

2. Folding and putting away the towering pile of laundry from the couch and admiring the stark, pristine beauty of that rarely-seen piece of furniture before bringing in a new load and starting the cycle all over again, like that moment never happened.

3. Having lunch with your family in the strong sunshine and feeling OK about your middle aged face when your daughter asks 'Mum, are you growing a beard?'

Scattered amongst the myriad joys of life on the homestead come these nuggets of heartbreak, and from these nuggety nuggets we grow strong and resilient, hearty of character, and wise,  comrades!

Shine on, you hairy, shambolic, filthy diamonds.
