# Mental Health Week: My Story

## 10th October 2014

A long,   long time ago, when I was a sprightly 24 year old fresh out of unimaversity, holding fierce Opinions about Things and dressed in op-shop grunge, I had an encounter with the deck of a speedboat that broke my (already fused and bolted like a bionic lady) spine.

A year or so followed, mostly spent in bed, and then a year or so running a cafe with my mum and my sister. Throughout it all my boyfriend and I broke up - slowly, the worst way.

I was in a lot of pain, a lot of the time, and even though there were wonderful moments, like when my sister Sam poured a 4 kilo bucket of beetroot on her head during the lunch rush, or when, at noon, the three of us would turn on the little TV and imitate Kerry Anne Kennerly's Midday Show dance-walking entrance, they were not, overall, happy days.

Sam and I lived in a little house on the corner of a highway. We didn't answer the phone, and sometimes we hid when people knocked on the door. I threw up in the shower every morning, and I felt like I would never have a normal life. Sam was such a good friend and help to me, but she was struggling with her own demons too.

I was pretty fucking depressed.

Twenty years on, I feel incredibly lucky. In lots of ways I'm living the fairy tale ending I never expected - here I am; three kids, busy life. No wheelchair. No more surgery. A level of pain that I can manage to mostly ignore.

My depression was grinding and awful, but I am lucky enough that I have never had to grapple with it since. I've been lucky. According to the<a href="http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/docs/Factsandfiguresaboutmentalhealthandmooddisorders.pdf"> Black Dog Institute</a>, one in five Australians experience a mental health issue every year. I've worked as a trauma counsellor, face to face, and I've worked as a volunteer for Lifeline too. I'm had many, many conversations with people who felt that their mental illness was preventing them from living their best life. And in my personal life, I don't think I have any friends who have not had some experience of anxiety or depression.

This week is Mental Health Week, and the ABC here in Australia has done an incredible job of programming across radio and television to extend the conversation  about mental health. The show '<a href="http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/changing-minds-the-inside-story/DO1340H001S00">Changing Minds</a>', filmed inside the locked ward of Liverpool Hospitals Mental Health Unit, is a fantastic watch. I cried every ten minutes, both at the bravery and struggle of the patients, and the kindness of the doctors. On the radio, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/schizophrenia/5654952">All in The Mind</a> has been exploring schizophrenia and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/sites/conversations/">Richard Fidler </a>has been interviewing guests about their stories of mental illness all week.

As the wonderful Dr Cross from Liverpool Hospital put it (I'm paraphrasing him): 'Mental illness cuts across class, race, age and gender. It can affect any one of us.'

Let's look after each other. Let's value kindness and compassion. Let's keep bringing the conversation out of the darkness.
