# Peanuts, You Bloody French Bitch!

## 23rd January 2014

I'm off this afternoon to see a bunch of my oldest,   dearest friends for a 40th in the countryside. I am so excited.  Moments away from soiling my Depend undergarments.

I am expecting:

<ul>

<li>Cackling</li>

<li>Snorting</li>

<li>Laugh-farting</li>

<li>Lounge-room dancing</li>

<li>Poolside napping</li>

<li>Fabulous food</li>

<li>Lengthy,  intense, uninterrupted conversation</li>

<li> A brief re-introduction to my my solo, kid-free self. I think a couple of days spent attending to the needs of my soul, my stomach and my liver will set me up perfectly for a  new school year, when my days will be focused on managing and looking after other people.</li>

</ul>

Did I mention I'm excited?

A weekend of this:

Lucky me!

Hope your weekend is as wonderful.
