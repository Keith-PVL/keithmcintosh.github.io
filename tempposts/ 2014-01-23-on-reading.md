# on reading

## 23rd January 2014

itemprop="articleBody" data-para-count="81" data-total-count="2523">James Baldwin,   one the authors who most spoke to my spirit, once put it this way:

itemprop="articleBody" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="2805">“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me the most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”
