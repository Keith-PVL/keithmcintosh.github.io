# Only Three Hotties Can Help Me Now

## 28th April 2014

Oh dear.

Urgghh.

Ewghghgh.

These noises are brought to you from endoscopic sinus surgery. All is well,   as planned,   no problems,   but eurrghghghgh. Plurghghgh. Orghghg.  I permanently have that burning sensation of having water up my nose; and it's not a pain that medication helps. Tomorrow I'm having the plastic stents that are still in my sinuses removed, and I'm hoping that will be the turning point.

In the meantime I am turning to three hotties in the hope that they hold the power to distract and heal me.

First: Pa Ingalls. Suspenders, no shirt.

Second: a fiery glance from Christopher Plummer.

Finally, the last straw. The big guns:  if sax solos, red crotch-roses and Rod Stewart  loosening his oversized bow tie won't help me, nothing will;  and ps- if this is not the best three minutes of your day, I don't think we have anything in common any more.
