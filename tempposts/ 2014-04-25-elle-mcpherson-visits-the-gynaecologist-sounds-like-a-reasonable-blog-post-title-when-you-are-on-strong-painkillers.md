# Elle McPherson Visits The Gynaecologist Sounds Like A Reasonable Blog Post Title When You Are On Strong Painkillers

## 25th April 2014

Home,   alive,   doing well.  Doc says success! All the blood dripping from my nose has meant not much sleep for the last couple of nights . I got up in the early hours to put a red pillowcase on and queried my decision to make up my convalescent bed in lovely white linens.

Feeling OK though. Much better than I had expected. Keith looking after me really well.

I'm watching The Americans and a little Real Housewives and picking through my book pile. Finished Judith Lucy. God I love her to pieces.

As far as I am aware, I did not tell filthy jokes about Elle MacPherson visiting the gynaecologist  to all patients and staff of the recovery room. (I shall tell you that tale another day. Num num num.)

So far, so good.
