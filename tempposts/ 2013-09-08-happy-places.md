# Happy Places

## 8th September 2013

Are you wondering what's making me happy this week?

No?

I'll tell you anyway.

First and foremost: Antibiotics! What ho modern medicine huzzah!  We've been sick for what feels like months,   to greater and lesser degrees of snot and vomit,    but this last week things took a turn for the wurst when the K-Dog's flu spiralled suddenly into pneumonia. He's recovering now,   but it slammed him down like a boss, and frightened the cheese out of me. Four of the five of us are on antibiotics now, the big guns,  and I am keen to begin repairing our immune systems, fattening up my poor depleted crew, and getting to the bottom of the stinky washing basket.

Silver linings: dinner deliveries  from loving friends and best-mums-in-world. If you don't need help, you don't get the chance to realise how lovely your people are. Well, hey, thanks, influenza!

French Beige nail polish (a little side-benefit of spending so much time in the chemist this week).

Joan Baez artist radio on Spotify. It's all Simon and Garfunkel, Woody Guthrie, Leonard Cohen, Dylan... easy listening for the bedraggled system.

Inadvertently brilliant rhyming from the 5 year old poet: **I am the truth. I am the law. I am the everything. I am the whore. **

Arrested Development, season 4, and the couch with the K-Dog. Binge-watching, eating cashew nuts, laughing, laughing, laughing. Happy happiness.

The end of the Australian federal election campaign. Sure, my team didn't win. But at least the godawful advertising is over, and we can move on. After a quick angry dance, that is.

Enjoying a friends Facebook updates as she backpacks with her husband and three kids through Turkey, and dreaming of one day doing the same.

Reading my friend Tori's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Suitcase-Spatula-Recipes-Stories-Around/dp/1849753490">transporting, lovely cookbook</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harley-Loco-Post-Punk-LowerEast-ebook/dp/B008EKOSDI">Harley Loco</a> by Rayya Ellis, a gritty New York story in the vibe of Patti Smith's Just Kids. Less poetic, but still good.

Mainly, I am feeling very grateful for returning health. It's been a tough couple of weeks. What about you? What are you watching? Reading? Eating? Any recommendations?
