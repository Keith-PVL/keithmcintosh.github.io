# Sick Of This Shit

## 27th April 2014

So I recently read this excellent,   brain-stretching account of 9/11 and the rise of Al Qaeda called <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110890.The_Looming_Tower">The Looming Tower</a> by Lawrence Wright (who wrote an equally dense and gripping book about Scientology). I've passed it onto Keith for our little book club-of-two discussion and this morning in bed he was reading the part about Osama Bin Laden's father,   who had an 'unknown' number of wives. Unknown,   because it was Bin Laden's practice to 'marry' and 'divorce' a woman on the same day if he just felt like a novelty shag.

Osama's mother was fourteen when he married her. When tired of his wives, he married them off to his employees. Executives, if they were lucky.

While Keith read this section,  I was reading this <a href="http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/millionaire-playboy-dan-bilzerian-threw-a-naked-porn-star-janice-griffith-off-the-roof-of-his-mansion/story-fnixwvgh-1226897064505">article</a> on a news site about a 'playboy asshole' who threw a 'nude porn star' (in other words, a teenage girl at his party) off a roof into a pool. He missed. She broke her ankle. Fun times!

And it just made me think; this shit never ends.

By luck, geography, some unknowable throw of the cosmic dice, my daughters, my friends and I have only the 'nude porn star' and the 'everyday sexism' bullshit to navigate.  We're not being abducted in Nigeria, or shot in the head in Afghanistan for trying to go to school, or raped on a Delhi bus for having the outrageous temerity to be out at night.

But it's all part of the same old story.

And my nose hurts.
