It's been a week since writing here. My fingers are itching to figure things out a little. I'm feeling...out of sorts.

New Year.

We bailed on a party up the road and spent the night watching Harry Potter with the kids and eating chips. Bed before eleven. K quietly got pissed while I held a hot washcloth to my blocked and painful sinuses.

I've been spending a sorry hour or two with middle -of-the-night insomnia lately. I think lying down aggravates my sinuses. Yesterday,   my back started playing up too, so when I woke up for last night's midnight party with myself, lying in miserable silence was oppressive.

I headed out to the lounge room to watch TV for a while.  Keith, solid as ever, traipsed out behind me and kept me company. On the couch, we experienced the joys of early morning free-to-air TV. We watched a little horrifying TMZ: celebrity-baiting by pumpkin-tanned creeps. We flicked around the hilarious Ken doll hosts on early morning American TV. Billy Crystal on Letterman was semi- funny, but his  'prematurely chestnut' hair was disconcerting. The best show was an evangelical couple - the minister earnestly speaking for his wife; who nodded like a doll -  introducing an Australian preacher, who just could not pull off the theatre of American evangelism with her 'chicks for Jesus' kind of folksy Outback shtick.

Keith and I lay on the lounge with a beach towel over our cold feet.  I necked back some Sudafed.

'You're my best friend,' I said to Keith.

'I'm your only friend,' he said.

Ha ha! It's not true, of course. Ha ha!

But then...

This is what happens when I feel like crap: I isolate. I become very protective of my limited energy and I retreat to solitude wherever I can carve it out. I've felt, over the the last six months, often unwell, often overwhelmed. Life with small children is undeniably busy. There is work, there is housework, there is writing work, and always, relentless forward motion. The next thing,the next thing.

I have been bad at keeping up with my friends. Text here, email there. Facebook 'like'. Quick Instagram comment. Social media is in fact a great boon for these times - I need to retreat and conserve the juice in the tank, and at least online, I can feel connected in part to what's going on outside my little nest.



I have read many resolution posts, years-in-review, Christmas and holiday wrap-ups. I feel happy for people that are so organised and well-adjusted, thoughtfully making plans for the year ahead. I'm not one of you this year. (Ever?)

I am lucky to have a beautiful family, supportive parents nearby, to live in a free democracy, to have food and shelter and luxuries like takeaway coffee and osteopathy and iTunes. I have so many happy and heartwarming moments with the kids and Keith, every day.



Why am I  recounting this stuff? Shut up! I often think. Cease! Desist! What kind of strange little diary are you curating here? For what? For **who**?

I'm not sure of the answer to that, but I do know this: What is the point of this space if not to be honest? What is it otherwise? Bad fiction? A third-rate magazine? These witterings may be pointless, but at least they should mean something.

I don't know where this little blog will travel this year. I know I have some really interesting interviews for you. I have some wiser minds than mine tackling the everyday domestic issues that interest me. I have plans, and at least three ideas, and I hope to roam widely, bringing back interesting offerings for you. You can think of me like a farty old Labrador, if you like, offering you up some dead mice every once in a while. The mice might stink, and okay, the dog does too, but you know, in the right light, she has a charming smile. And her furry back is nice to put your feet on.

its been a week itching to write and stumped for woards at the same time.

 

posts all positive, full of acheiveemtnes,  its been atougher year with many beuatoiful moments. Poor health is isolating and embarresing. Stupid.

My worst come to the fore/

I'm not excatly sure of the point of writing here, but I know that I am trying to find truth. What is the point of writing here without truth? Curating some pointless diary?

I have coming up interviews with some wonderful people. Shared wisdom from sharper minds than mine. Thoughts on books and other cultural colected by my magpie mind.

Mostly, I am aiming for truth. Painful and revealing though it may be.

Thanks for reading, and happy 2014 to you.
