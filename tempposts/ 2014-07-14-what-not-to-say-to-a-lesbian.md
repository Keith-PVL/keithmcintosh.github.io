<p File this post under the 'useful life hacks' banner. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/09/25/10_things_not_to_say_to_a_lesbian_partner/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">This article</a> is full of excellent information,   but mainly it makes me want to be a lesbian just so when somebody asks me 'But how do you have sex?' I can answer thusly:</p>

<blockquote>Well,   first we make an offering to the Goddess. Then we walk counter-clockwise in a circle around a bowl of flax seeds while reciting lines from the Indigo Girls canon. Somewhere around the seventh rotation, our vaginas fuse together in spiritual and ecstatic union. Afterward, we drink rooibos tea and discuss prison reform.</blockquote>

Back to school tomorrow! May your morning run as smoothly as a the acerbic put-down of a funny lesbian. We've got swimming, Girl Guides and rugby all booked in for this term. Itsa gonna be a busy one.
