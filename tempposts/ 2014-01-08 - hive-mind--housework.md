# Hive Mind- Housework

## 8th January 2014

HOUSEWORK.

OH MY GOD.

It never ends,   it never ends, itnever ends.

How do you managhe it?

I have called in some experts today.

Beth of Babymac (Australia's Martha Stewart but a better food photgrapher), and Em from the Beetleshack are here today to crack the nut of the housework dilemma. How do we handle the relentless, never-ending tide of housework? What do we do when we feel we might actually, literally, lose our shit? How do you keep up with children that can untidy faster than you can tidy?

Beth is a systems woman.

**1. Treat the relentless, mundane, soul destroying work as something that just has to be done. . **

Like going to the bathroom, or going to sleep, drinking water, this shit just needs to get done. You have to tackle in bursts, and NEVER, I repeat NEVER stop half way. Set yourself a quick 15 min window with a few goals in it: for me I can get all the beds made, dishes packed and breakfast cleaned up in 15 mins. 15 mins never killed anyone did it? Go like the clappers - a cleaning whirling dervish if you will - and then reward yourself and do nothing for a few hours. I tackle washing like this. Any one household task. You will note though, that I am mental. And OF COURSE I occasionally think I will lose my shit if a knife with vegemite is placed on the sink rather than the dishwasher for the 675th time. I'm only human, even though I may have super neat powers.

**2. Don't be afraid to shout.  **

<span I am a wild shouter. I have learnt over the past 12 months or so to give warnings to all members of my family that I am nearing shout mode. So I suppose I am a creeping wild shouter. It goes a bit like this: "Daisy you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 7 minutes. Daisy you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 5 minutes. Daisy and Harper you are not listening to me, you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 4 minutes. If you don't start to get dressed, I am going to get cranky and I am going to shout at you both. GET DRESSED." I also swear when I am shouty. It's not good I know, but I do it. They know I am serious when the swearing begins.  </span>

**<span 3. Now I will share my shameful housekeeping secret.</span>**

<span Cupboard Management. Open any cupboard in my house and you will see shit spilling from it. I have a friend who was SHOCKED with the state of all my cupboards. If it has doors and can be shut then I don't care what happens in there. I need to work on this, except then I remember that I have a life and really cannot be fucked. I think I need to live in an open shelved house.</span>

**4. The question I had to ask: You have a beautiful house, gorgeously styled, Beth. It's like homestead porn. Is this really a brilliant illusion that you have created while you type maniacally at your laptop in a dingy shed like the Unabomber? Just asking. **

My house actually looks like it does on the blog and Instagram ALL THE TIME. As I said, I'm mental. I like clean and neat for my state of mind - always have since I was a girl - and it's not going to change. Of course mess comes with life and we have kids, lots of visitors and entertaining so of course mess is around at times but dead set, it's usually like this. Ask any of my friends or family...just don't open the cupboards!!!

<span Thanks Em and Beth. The  More from Beth on the big issues of domestic life here, here and here. And visit Em to read about life with small children, craft, art and gardening. </span>
