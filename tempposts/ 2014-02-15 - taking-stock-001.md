This is what is going down in Mogantosh town.

Making : Banana bread to freeze for school lunchboxes.

Cooking : Souvlaki.

Drinking : Lemon cordial and soda water.

Reading: 20th century lesbian classic The Well Of Loneliness.

Wanting: Not much...Life is sweet.

Looking: Foxy! Not really. Hairy.

Playing: 500 with the kids and Keith.

Enjoying: the fact that I finally found my yellow Saltwater sandal (lost for a year!)

Liking: the <a href="http://shows.howstuffworks.com/stuff-you-missed-in-history-class-podcast.htm">Stuff You Missed In History Class</a> podcast. (Casanova was a great episode.)

Wondering: what to wear to a play tonight (excited to see my friend Al perform her actor magic).

Loving: Shared jokes with my seven year old.

Pondering: Book-review blog posts on true crime, lady-love and the  natural world.

Considering: How to approach my grey hairs.

Watching: House Of Cards. Zomg so very good!<a href="http://www.branchshop.com/">

</a>Hoping: That kindy will continue to go smoothly for small T-Bone.

Marvelling: At the glorious imaginative gorgeousness of the two-year-old.

Smelling: Like lamb and coffee.

Wearing: Trackie pants with a massive hole in the crotch, tea-towel around neck. What all the glamorous young things are wearing. I'm pretty sure.

Following: Maria Popova at <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings. </a>

Noticing: How long and lanky the kids are getting.

Thinking: About Edward Snowden and peach muffins (not together).

Feeling: Excited about the year ahead.

Admiring: Beautifully groomed women like my friend Charlotte, whose hair just went pink.

Sorting: Kids clothes and bedrooms.

Buying: Contact paper

Feeling: Little arms and legs wrapped around me like a litter of puppies.

Coveting: a newly-released book about Pussy Riot, an original Arco lamp
