# Overnight Bread

## 25th August 2014

his no-knead method basically replaces the usual  kneading time with a very long prove on the kitchen counter. This way,   the gluten develops through a long,   slow fermentation and the bread develops a delicious flavour. Many recipes use a second proving time but we never even bother, and the bread is delicious.



Here's our recipe, the simplest version of them all:





<ul>

<li> 3 cups of flour, 1 3/4 tsp of salt and half a teaspoon of yeast. Use your fingers to spread the dry ingredients around the bowl, which helps to start the yeast activating. (We add a little LSA or kibble grain here too.) Then, add the water and mix until it just comes together into a sloppy ball.</li>

<li>Leave it overnight in a bowl covered in plastic wrap. We tend to make it after school, and bake it in the morning. Anywhere between 12 and 24 hours proving time is OK.</li>

<li>In the morning, take a cast iron pot (I use my Le Crueset here), and heat it, lid on, in the oven at 200 for twenty minutes.</li>

<li>Take the sloppy bread mix out of the bowl and drop it in a little flour on the counter. Flip it over and into your pot, and bake it in the oven (lid on) for half and hour, lid off for another fifteen minutes.</li>

</ul>

Making bread is a great after-school activity for slightly frazzled, post-institutionalised kids.  Hands in dough, creating, chatting to Mum all the while. Ivy likes to rope Ted in as her soux-chef, talking him through every step with a good amount of big-sisterly condescension. It's a good system , this - we have another loaf to cook at lunchtime the next day.
