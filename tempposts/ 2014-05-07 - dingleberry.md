Hive Mind – Family Dinner

Could you take us through a typical family dinner at your place?

I rarely cook the same thing- it is often a last minute 'what's in the fridge' affair. There is always music and candles and conversation. The rest is usually a surprise! My big kids are happy to eat whatever I serve so weeknight dinners mean I can cook whatever I like and they will happily eat along with me &amp; my husband. This isn't the case for the littles (but I now have the experience to know they will outgrow it and it doesn't matter) - it is super simple food for them i.e; cheese on toast,   dippy eggs, pancakes, simple stir fries, fried rice, homemade chicken nuggets etc.

I’m working on a plan that each of my kids will start cooking one meal a week for the family from the age of ten. At ten, they get the ‘keys to the kitchen’, at which point they are free to create whatever they like in there. How involved are your kids in the family kitchen?

What a great plan! I hope it comes to life! I started cooking for our family of seven aged 10yo too. To many surprised folks out there it really can happen! In our house the involvement of my kids is from the choosing of the ingredients at the Farmers Markets to the final dish. Whilst my kids don't have any scheduled time in the kitchen I am happy for them to be involved at any time. The unplanned sessions are often the most enjoyable. I like to think that as we are all in the kitchen most of the time that they are learning form absorption as well. And to be honest for me the importance for me lies in the time we spend together in the kitchen more than what they cook . I think my kids have an incredible knowledge of food already because of the way it is viewed in our house.

Do you do dessert?

No we don't. I have never done dessert &amp; I guess it is partly because we didn't do it as kids either. But I am really not much of a sweet tooth. Although my husband just bought me an icecream maker.....dangerous.

Do you have dinner rituals: best-and-worst of the day, cards after clean-ups, board games?

I love this question- mostly for the ideas of yours about what could happen afterwards but to be honest time is such a limited commodity in my house with five boys that whilst I would love to say I do....I don't. I am too busy herding arious humans to bath, bed &amp; story time before Dinner round two!

Who cleans up?

My boys do the Dishwasher. I clean up after myself as I cook.

What’s your philosophy or underlying thinking about the family table?

There are two main things for me that are my driving philosophy. The first is the importance of cooking real food and being thoughtful about our footprint on our precious earth. Eating ethically is important to me. I want my children to grow up knowing that it i important to take responsibility for their actions and to feel a sense of responsibility to the broader community. Human beings live in a society as a group and I feel we have a responsibility to take care of each other. To be mindful that our choices about the way we behave in all aspects of our lives have an impact on others- our choices about food is not separate from this.

Just as importantly is seeing the time spent at the Family Table as an investment in the heart &amp; souls of the people you are sharing with. The food doesn't need to be fancy. It just needs to be served with love. People are what count.

Finally: a favourite family meal (feel free to link here.)

We honestly don't really have a family favourite as I rarely serve the same thing twice........ but the ingredients that are in EVERY family meal are : Love, Laughter, Music &amp; Togetherness. It always tastes delicious.

My favourite time of the day is 6 o’clock. That’s when Keith appears from his office down the bottom of the garden, the kids are summoned from their various hidey-holes, and we all sit down for dinner together.

It does not always smoothly. Someone is likelyand dd a couple of good kokes here.

in general it’s difficuly to keep all three kids planted in their seats at the table.

But I love it, and I persist. I love planning meals and menus. In the summer we eat outside, and in the winter we eat by candelight. Sometimes there is candelight sometimes music, and sometimes after dinner there are card and games. In the winter we try and learn poetry. (Are you having a little wholesomeness-vomit? My apologies.) Family dinner feels very sacred to me. Not every family is able to manage this time together. Shift work and long commutes can make it hard.

I’ve asked a couple of food and family bloggers to talk today about their experiences of family dinnertime. Ruth has five kids and Mel has too

Mel from Coal Valley View has five kids aged nine, seven, five-year-old twins and a seventeen month old baby.

How often do you have dinner together?

We generally have dinner together every night, usually as soon as Daniel walks in the door, somewhere between 6 and 6.30. It's something that's really important to us. We lived in Sydney a couple of years ago and the commuting and long work hours just didn't make this possible. We really missed not being able to eat together as a family. We eat breakfast together on weekends however weekday breakfasts usually involve the Kids helping themselves and eating around the table while one of us makes their lunches for School (and the other finds their socks!).

What’s a typical family dinner at your place?

Dinners are a pretty slapdash affair at the moment. The kids are still young and I'm usually pretty tired by the end of the day so the focus has been on simple, healthy food with as minimal preparation time as possible. I just throw things together, nothing fancy. They are all fantastic eaters. We used to entertain a lot and I do love cooking but with the kids the ages they are, especially with a baby, my priorities are elsewhere. I'm looking forward to devoting more time to spicing things up (pardon the pun) in the kitchen down the track. I cook from scratch but I've never menu-planned and rarely consult cookbooks. I tend to recycle the old faithfuls - Spaghetti Bolognase, Risotto, Lasagne, Stir Fry, Curry and Sunday Roasts. Daniel loves cooking so he takes over the cooking role on weekends and Dinners are a lot more exciting.

I’m working on a plan that each of my kids will start cooking one meal a week for the family from the age of ten. At ten, they get the ‘keys to the kitchen’, at which point they are free to create whatever they like in there. How involved are your kids in the family kitchen?

This is my dream too - all 5 Kids cooking a meal a night! Our 9 year old is excellent in the Kitchen and already does a lot of cooking. She'll bake cakes in the afternoons without any assistance at all and on weekends she'll prepare and cook the pancakes. The boys enjoy helping me prepare food because they are always in the kitchen and always hungry! They love being in the Vegetable Garden and picking things out themselves to eat for Dinner too.

Do you do dessert?

Not every single night during the week but as much as possible, even if its just a bowl of ice-cream. Weekends always involve the baking of cakes and yummy desserts (because that's when Daniel is in charge of things :-)).

Do you have dinner rituals: best-and-worst of the day, cards after clean-ups, board games? Not really. We tend to let the conversation flow organically but we make sure everyone gets a chance to talk without everyone talking over the top of each other. Our biggest challenge is getting them to sit sill long enough to eat their meals.

Who cleans up? The Kids help clear the table and whoever doesn't cook is usually in charge of cleaning up.

What’s your philosophy or underlying thinking about the family table? I think it's a wonderful way to connect as a family. There are no distractions at the family table, just the seven of us enjoying each other's company.

Finally: a favourite family meal (feel free to link here.) The Kids would probably say Lasagne. I know we are rolling into a super-busy time of year. No deadline. Write whenever you can. I look forward to putting the post together. Thanks again, so much, Mel xxxRach

How many children do you have and what are their ages?

I have 5 boys- Jasper,15yo, max, 13yo, Oscar 11yo, Gus 7yo &amp; Archie 5yo.

How often do you manage family dinner together, and is that the only meal the family shares?

As the ages of my children vary so much- so do weeknight bedtimes. This means that there are

2 sittings for dinner- one for the littles and

one for the bigs. I sit down at both. On the weekend it is different- we try and eat every meal as a

family. I also eat breakfast with the big two (they are both at high school) every day. It is a time I

treasure with them. The only part of the day that feels truly uninterrupted with them.
