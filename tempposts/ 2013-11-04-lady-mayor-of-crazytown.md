# Lady Mayor of Crazytown

## 4th November 2013

**This post was originally published in Practical Parenting Magazine,   September 2013. This morning it is brought to you by the letters OMG and the colour green (with accents of carrot.) Last night the whole family (except me) spent the night throwing up. I had made a huge pot of vegetable soup for dinner,   with blueberries for dessert, so the puke was unspeakable. K started throwing up at 3am, and continued until 7.  The kids are pale and grumpy, K looks half-dead, and I'm a wreck, wrapped in a shambles, on a bed of pathos. The school receptionist says a vile new bug is sweeping the school. I'm ready to wrap our place in a giant Hazmat suit and call in the exorcists. **

**I'm writing this in a quarter-hour respite while the kids watch Cake Boss and eat grated apple. 'Mama I need you!' is moments away, and so is a  day in the laundry washing every towel in the house. **

** If you need me IRL today, reconsider, or come armed with garlic and holy water. **

You know you have had a stressful morning when the baby says ‘Fock! Fock!’ in the car on the way to day-care. Yes, my shame was deep, but in my defence, some of the words I didn’t say out loud were much, much worse. Mornings are often a bit frazzled when there are three children under seven to get to school, pre-school and day-care, but some mornings the chaos is beyond my control.

Last week, my husband Keith went away for work, leaving me alone, the Lady Mayor of Crazytown. In normal life, these kids of mine can move like rockets, but when it comes to getting ready to leave the house, their systems lock into go-slow. I have trouble focusing them on the tasks at hand – brush teeth, eat toast, walk to car – because they are so busy being complete nutcases. I mean ‘delightfully imaginative.’

Six –year-old Peanut is showing me how she can do four things at once. ‘Beep! Beep! Beep!” she shouts, while stamping her feet, clicking her fingers and wildly shaking her hair. ‘You do it Mum!’ she says. A headache is starting to throb behind my eyes, but I give it a go. Peanut’s underwhelmed. My clicking is sub-par. Plus, she doesn’t eat Vegemite anymore. What other food can I make?  Not that. What else? Not that. What else?

At my feet, Pudding the toddler is wailing for attention. ‘I dot poo-bum,’ she says. ‘Where is your other shoe, Peanut?’ I ask hopelessly. I change Pudding’s nappy while four-year-old T-Bone tells me about Upsy Down Town, his latest obsession. ‘Your teeth are on your feet, Mum. You brush your shoes. I’ll show you!’ He gets my toothbrush and starts rubbing it over the disgusting bottom of his gum boots.

I put the baby down to snatch my toothbrush back, and she toddles off to the bathroom, where she throws my makeup, piece, by piece, into the (still full) bath. ‘Hello! Hello!’ I hear. It’s T-Bone. He’s calling me from the toy phone and this means he wants me to make an order at the imaginary café he calls ‘T-Bone’s Yum Yums.’ I try to ignore him and finish brushing Peanut’s hair (it’s hard, she keeps dancing).  T-Bone gets louder.  ‘Hello! Hello!’

‘Hello, is that T-Bones Yum Yums?’ I say. ‘Peanut, stand still! Can I have an almond croissant and a strong latte please?’

‘There is no coffee machine’, says T-Bone.  ‘But you can have ten fairy possum cakes. Plus, in Upsy Down Town, you eat from your feet and you poo out your mouth.’

‘Poo mouth!’ says Pudding, but I’ve stopped listening. I’m filled with triumph, brandishing Ivy’s school shoe over my head like I have found the Holy Grail. I jam it on, and finish making lunches at warp speed. We are nearing the finish line. I have all three strapped into the car, and I have even wiped the vegemite from their faces with the violent, sudden, tea-towel ambush that mothers have employed throughout the ages.

And then, at the final hurdle, I can’t find the car keys. My patience suddenly snaps, the f-bomb is released, and it sails straight to the pure ears of the toddler and it lodges deeps. Oh well, I think.  Three kids fed and dressed, and out the door, even if I taught the baby to swear in the process. It might be the best I can do.
