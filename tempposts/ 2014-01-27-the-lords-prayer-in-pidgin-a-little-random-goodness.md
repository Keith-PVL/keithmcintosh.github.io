# The Lords Prayer in Pidgin (A Little Random Goodness)

## 27th January 2014

If you are a word-nerd,   can I suggest you make a cup of tea and settle in to peruse this gem; a copy of the Lords Prayer in Pidgin that I found in a little book called Oddities, published in 1975 by the Readers Digest.

Take your time and think through the logic. It's really delightful.** **

**Papa belong me-fella, you stop long heaven**

**All ‘e sanctu ‘im name belong you**

**Kingdom belong you ‘e come**

**All’e hear ‘im talk belong you long ground**

**All same long heaven.**

**Today givem kaikai belong day long me-fella.**

**Forgive ‘im wrong belong me-fella all-same me-fella**

**forgive ‘im wrong all ‘e makem long me-fella.  **

**You no bring-em me-fella long try ‘im.**

**Take ‘way some t’ing nogood long me-fella. **

Amazing language.
