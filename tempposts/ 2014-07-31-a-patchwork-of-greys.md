# A Patchwork Of Greys

'Comforts of Home': (<a href="http://www.junipergallery.com/node/1415">1861) District of Columbia. Tent life of the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry at Queen's Farm,   vicinity of Fort Slocum.</a>

The other morning,   I spent a few hours cleaning and decorating the bedrooms in the house so I could take fancy pictures of them for a house-swapping website. I dusted, decluttered and made beds with care. I swept Lego, loom bands and headless Barbies off the floor and I carefully, lovingly positioned a decorative stone elephant. Then I stood back and admired my work. Usually I shlump about feeling like Alice from the Brady Bunch, but today, I totally felt like a hip young thing. Finger on the pulse of style, etc. This room is gorgeous! I thought. Like, magazine gorgeous! I decided that I would live like this from now on.

<br />

But then I went into the rest of the house, where - oh hai!- I found all the jobs that had waited for me as I thoughtfully moved my elephant an inch left and back again.  A pile of laundry had migrated from the couch onto the floor.  The washing up had conquered the sink and was mounting an attack on the whole kitchen bench. The yogurt-smeared on the kitchen window sent a soft, dappled light over the unwashed bowls of Weet-Bix cement and damp, abandoned towels. (I still had my inner photographer, even if my inner stylist had gone home.)

<br />

The bubble burst. Here’s the thing – no matter how hard I try, how fast I move, or how many lists I make, I can’t keep all my balls in the air at once.  If one area of my life is under control, another is falling apart. It’s a mathematical certainty. There is just not enough time and space to be on top of everything, what with kids, marriage, a house, work, friendships and so many Real Housewives to keep track of. When I’m present and focused on one area of life (the perfect placement of that decorative elephant), I have taken my attention from another part (every other crappy housework job waiting in line).

<br />

This absolutely applies to life with kids as well. I’ve got three to split my attention between, and all three scramble for the parental gaze, all of the time. The louder ones pull focus, but it’s a well-known parental law that when kids go quiet they are up to the most mischief. In quiet times, I think about the needs of my children; their dreams and their development, but in the moment I find myself shouting ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’ more than ‘Sit down, tell me more.’ Being a good mum is far and away my most important job, but there’s no certain right and wrong I can attach to; no black and white truth. Just shades of grey, with successes and failures, and lots of flawed reality and hard-won wisdom that intrudes on and re-shapes my consciously imagined picture of family life.

<br />

I like to keep in mind the Japanese art of ‘wabi-sabi’ – finding the beauty in life’s imperfections. This goes for housekeeping, interiors projects, parenting and perhaps most of all, personal grooming. (It’s chilly outside, but my furry lady-hair stockings are keeping my legs toasty warm. Perspective, you see, can be very handy.) I strive to find joy in the small things; to revel in perfect imperfection and to remind myself, when I am feeling overwhelmed by my desire to do better, that a life well lived is a patchwork of greys. And when I need a boost, I shall look at those photos of the beautiful bedroom with the decorative elephant and remember that it really did look like that, for just one brief, glorious hour.
