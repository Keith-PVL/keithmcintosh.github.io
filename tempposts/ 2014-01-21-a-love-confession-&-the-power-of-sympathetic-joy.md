# A Love Confession & The Power Of Sympathetic Joy

## 21st January 2014

The kids are eating popcorn and watching a movie (school holiday afternoon joys) and I feel compelled to tell you,   dear readers, that I have love in my heart for television doctor Dr. Drew Pinski; therapist to the stars.

Gentle, loving Drew  really feels their Celebrity sadness.

He is never shocked by their sordid Celebrity secrets, although he may take a moment to adjust.

He listens. He really listens.

He...wait. What? Doctor Drew!

At breakthrough moments, he smiles, and a unicorn gets its wings.

Imagine my joy when I recently discovered that Dr. Drew has his own podcast. <a href="http://drdrew.com/104-dr-dan-siegel/">This episode</a> pairs Drew with Dr. Dan Siegel, a neuropsychiatrist and specialist in adolescent psychology. If you find this stuff  fascinating, like I do, you will love this forty-five minutes of discussion between two thoughtful brain-detectives.

It veers into psychobabble and Hollywood woo-woo at times. Bear with Dr. Drew. This earnestness is part of his bespectacled charm, I promise. Dr. Drew and Dr. Dan explore the notions of satisfaction vs.happiness, and they discuss the idea of 'sympathetic joy', or the art of finding happiness in the successes of others.

I loved this idea. It has stayed with me since.

Bless you Dr. Drew, you four-eyed hunk of sweet man meat. And reader, may you have a wonderfully successful day, or failing that, may you feel inspired or delighted by the successes of those you love.
