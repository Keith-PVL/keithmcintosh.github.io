# Hack a Banana, Make A Keyboard

## 12th December 2013

Jay Silver's invention,   the MaKey MaKey, turns everyday objects into computer interfaces. It's mind-blowing.

<p This<a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/"> eight year-old</a>, for instance, invented a knife-and-log interface for cutting virtual wood.</p>

'I used to want to design a perfect society, or a utopic world, or something like that,' says Silver. 'But as I'm getting older and messing with all this stuff, I'm realising that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and their kitchens. And that's the world I really want to live in.'

Me too Jay, you fabulous, brilliant nerd. Me too!

Is there a geek in your life? You can buy the MaKey MaKey <a href="http://joylabz.myshopify.com/products/makey-makey-kit">here</a>. Missed the Christmas cutoff though. (I'm so bookmarking this for the kids.)

PS - Before the MaKey MaKey, Silver invented <a href="http://singingfingers.com/">Singling Fingers</a>, which lets users 'play with sound as though it were finger paint'.
