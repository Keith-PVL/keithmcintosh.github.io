# Notes on Life From A Wollongong Cafe

## 11th September 2014

Let me paint you a picture of life as lived in a Wollongong cafe. (Please note,   snide mockery aside,   I love Wollongong. I really do.)

Now,   prepare yourselves for sophistication and wit. Imagine, perhaps, the round table at the Algonquin in 1956, or Maxims of Paris during the Belle Epoque.

Here's what I overheard. A group of suits are talking about a recent holiday they spent together in America. One man tells a tale of a friend that befouled himself so badly while drunk that 'when I stepped in the room it come up between my toes.’

A woman in the group adds that she and her friends 'spent heaps at the Playboy Mansion. We deserve it! Our husbands are throwing money up their arses and bums!’

This sentence threw me. Arses AND bums? What does that even mean? Cocaine? Bottom-sex? What? I swear, these are her exact words. I was listening hard and taking careful notes. (Don't deconstruct me. )

It's hard to concentrate on other writing when conversations like these are happening.

On my Wednesday writing days (all three kids in various institutions), I vary my routine between a cafe in town that hates children and the local library. I was out of my usual zone when I crossed paths with the  'arses and bums' crowd. But the scene reminded me of when I wrote about trying to work at the public library.

<blockquote>

<h3 itemprop="name"><span 1. A pair from the University of The Third Age sit at the table next to me. When Lady Senior first describes her personal project of learning Esperanto, I think 'Oh my god.  When I retire, I am so learning Esperanto.' Twenty minutes later, 'For the love of fuck, please stop talking about Esperanto before I stab myself in the eye with a pen.' Also, flirting techniques for seniors: 'Oh, you so don't look like a grandmother,' followed by a tone adjustment to Low, Earnest, Really Listening levels and adding 'And are you </span><i fully ready *<span for that change in your life?'</span></h3>

2. Stupid hipster barista gives me a dirty look when I asked him for more coffee in my coffee. A cup of foamy milk is not a latte, dude. I am not the twit here. You are the twit! You are the twit! Say clever and cutting things to him inside my head. Actually not very clever. More like 'You think you're good. But you're not.'

<br />



3.  Accidentally pour hot coffee on self and shriek 'Fucky fuck! Fuck!' Quietly accept dirty looks from amorous seniors. Bad library behaviour. I am the twit.



<br />

4. Apply Pomodoro Technique to writing work and struggle to focus for twenty minutes. Sadly realise have the attention span of an adolescent chimpanzee. Unfortunately have more responsibilities.



<br />

5. Check time for optometrist appointment and think about frames for reading glasses. Realise that while mocking seniors next door, I am in fact, tripping, metaphorically, on the heels of their orthopaedic sandals.





6. Mmmmmm. Orthopaedic sandals.

<br />

7.  Seniors are leaving, undoubtedly for the early bird dinner special at the club.

<br />

8. Mmmm. Schnitzel.

<br />

9. Young man with wild hair has just set up his laptop opposite mine and is now eating Jaffas by the handful. This is why I love the library.

<br />

10. Stingy young bastard is not offering any Jaffas and now all I can think about is Jaffas. This is why I hate the library.

<br />

11. Totes! Awks! Male Senior just turned and stared intently at me for an uncomfortable moment. Was he thinking about his 'personal project' and forgot to turn off his staring gaze? Have I been mumbling out loud again? Or, sick of talking about Esperanto, is he turning his Casanova stylings to the coffee-stained, muttering woman to the left in the 'outfit'?

9. Realise that while I have been gently mocking seniors in my head, they have spent all morning engaged in light erotic banter and unpressured research. Meanwhile I have a busy afternoon in front of me full of cooking, cleaning, chaffeuring and refereeing who 'started it'. I am the twit. I am the twit.

<br />

10. Mmm. Retirement.</blockquote>

Wherever you are today, have fun. And just to make these last five minutes of your life not such a terrible waste, Here's the one phrase in Esperanto that should open doors and throw rose petals at your feet in life: 'Tiu ?i sinjoro/sinjorino pagos por ?io', or 'the lady/gentleman will pay for everything'.
