# A Poo Machine, A Glass of Rose and The Wall O'Gina's: One Afternoon At MONA

## 8th December 2014

Trying to get Keith to say 'i knowb what i like..'

 

Is it me,   or is it modern art?

 

Tedddy skilling along: ginas! Ginas!

 

How much the poo machine really smelt.

 

Afternoon in the sunshind drinking rose and eating cherries. Dancing. Beautiful experience.
