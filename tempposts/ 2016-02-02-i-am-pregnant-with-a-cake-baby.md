# I Am Pregnant With A Cake Baby

## 2nd February 2016

Back on the school run.

Friends and comrades,   it's been a long time since I have graced this space with my pointless ramblings,   ill-constructed arguments,   knee-jerk opinions and bum jokes.

How are you?

It'e been a busy summer, and I'm ready to return to the hermit life.

4 year old Pudding has started pre-school this year. A note came home yesterday asking parents to remember to put sunscreen on the children, label the lunchboxes and make sure they were wearing covered shoes. Three strikes for me! The only way is up.

Peanut in year 4 is all about her club The Nerd University of Unicornia and her band The Random Dumbos. T-Bone, in Year 2, remains my favourite weirdo. Here's a sample conversation:

He: Mum! Truth or dare?

Me: Truth

He: One day you will die

Me: I don't think you understand this game

I'm trying to do this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene">30 days of Yoga </a>(I like this lady, she's good value). I have the crazy-eyed evangelical decluttering disorder and I'm intent on Kon-Mari'ng the stuffing out of my whole house. The children better not look at me sideways or they'll be in a Salvation Army bin quicker than they can say 'I don't like this dinner.'

To be honest, I am still trying to get past the first level 'laundry/washing-up/what is there to eat Mum/I think I've got nits' part of housekeeping before I can even get to the clutter. But I am having some delightful daydreams about it. Anyway, don't ask me what the Kon-Mari method is. I will tell you and you will regret having entered into the whole conversation.

In short:

1. A slightly nutty and earnest mum at the school gates asked me today 'Are you having a baby?' Look, no, I'm not, but I did question whether it was a good idea to tuck my t-shirt into my skirt this morning so thanks for sorting that out for me.

2. I am planning Undercover Mother, where I gather a group of school mums to do dawn raids on the town and nail giant granny-bloomers on all the telegraph poles.  Watch this space.

3. Nude suits to the first P and C meeting of the year. Yes or no?

Welcome to 2016! I may have forgotten how to write a blog post.
