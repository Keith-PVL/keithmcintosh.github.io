# Recency Buck

## 8th June 2014

When a section of your spine has been threatening to pop out of it's proper alignment and say hello,   it is a massive relief when it retreats back into place.It's like say they - it's almost worth hitting yourself in the head with a hammer just for the pleasure of stopping.

Peanut is reading Tintin,   T-Bone is drawing step-by-step animals and young Pudding is singing 'Let It Go' into a toilet paper roll. Me,   I'm pulling out and sorting the winter woolies. Finding the old favourites. I've been reading Georgette Heyer's 'Regency Buck' this morning.

This day could only be improved if a chaise dawn by four handsome chestnuts clattered suddenly into the front yard, and outjumped the arrogant dandy Lord Worth. Â Behold:

<blockquote>

<p He was the epitome of a man of fashion. His beaver hat was set over black locks carefully brushed into a semblance of disorder; his cravat of starched muslin supported his chin in a series of beautiful folds; his driving-coat of drab cloth bore no less than fifteen capes, and a double row of silver buttons.</p>

</blockquote>

A girl can dream.

May your public holiday Monday be unfolding so smoothly.
