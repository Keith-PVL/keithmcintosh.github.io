# Adventures In Exercise (Part 1)

## 7th February 2014

If I hadn't just written a column on exercise,   I'd have to invent another reason to post this aerobics video. Comedy, athletics and spangled unitards. Gold stars all round!

I’ve got what you might call some interesting spinal architecture, after two fusion operations, and one freaky boat accident that resulted in a broken back. A series of rods and screws hold my spine together. It makes for X-rays that can freak people out (but I don’t beep going through the airport machine, thanks for asking) and a history with chronic pain that has gone up and down more than a toddlers mood in the afternoon.

Even without the bad-back history, having three kids puts your body through the wringer. Every mum I know needs to exercise to stay in shape for the physical marathon of motherhood. Cleaning, driving, carrying, lifting, stroller-wrangling and walking the floor with sick babies is a hugely athletic way to spend your days. Who knew? I didn’t really think through that part of the equation. I’m more of the ‘I lied about being the outdoor type’ type.

After having babies, I have worked hard to overcome the basic laziness of a body built for leisure, and forced myself into different fitness pursuits to try and strengthen my mid-section, which would rather not be hardened. It would prefer to be made soft and comfy with the application of Earl Grey tea and Toblerone.

For my next few columns, I’m going to take you through some of my experiences.  Just to be clear: do not picture Michelle Bridges. I repeat NOT. Visualise instead a forty-two year old woman in the wrong clothes desperately trying not to fart in the face of her Pilates instructor.

And now I’ve set the tone, I’ll go on. Ah, pilates…that was after my second child T-Bone was born. This technique is deceptively calm-looking, but works intensively to strengthen the core muscles of the trunk. Over time, I got more used to it, but my first session was very stressful, as my internal organs got a serious massage. I got gassier and gassier as the minutes ticked by. While ‘Tony’, the earnest, humourless instructor crouched with his head at my belly to see if I was getting the stomach breathing right, sweat beaded my forehead. I was trying so hard not to fart that it was in fact an incredibly athletic workout.

After that ‘Anna’ worked on my pelvic floor, the muscle that keeps Mums out of trampoline tournaments. Anna wore cat-eyes glasses, sported an oddly square hairstyle and had the twitchy demeanour of somebody failing to get the dose of their anxiety medication right. Beside me on her hands and knees, Anna leaned in and stage-whispered ‘You must work HARD on this muscle for SEXUAL reasons; it will improve the FEEL of you for your partner and really STRENGTHEN your orgasm.’ I smiled weakly and begged internally STOP TALKING DEAR GOD IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY STOP TALKING. Worse, then Anna’s partner arrived, and he crouched and chatted too. All I could do was picture him and Anna having sex as her glasses steamed up and he complimented her pelvic floor tone.

Pilates did not last long for me, and I never gained much core strength from my time with Tony and Anna. Still, by the end of our relationship, my sphincter could snap a pencil, which I’m counting as a fitness win. Next month: adventures in yoga and the time I insulted a fellow yogi by asking if she wrote pornographic Star Trek fan fiction on the Internet. Man, how I wish I was joking.
