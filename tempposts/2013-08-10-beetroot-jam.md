# Beetroot Jam

## 10th August 2013

I am having a little love affair with beetroot,   and as luck would have it,   here we are rolling into Winter,   the best season for these scarlet orbs of deliciousness. (Ooh, I've come over all Nigella.)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA4d2ZvqOBA">Sexy is as sexy does</a>, Nigella, you dirty beast.

 

Beetroot Jam recipe. From here<a href="http://www.light-food-full-of-flavour.com/beetroot-jam.html">http://www.light-food-full-of-flavour.com/beetroot-jam.html</a>, but alter the recipe and make it my own.

<b>For the jam:</b>

2 tablespoons rapeseed (canola) or olive oil

1 red onion, peeled, halved and finely sliced

250g, 9oz, 1¼ cup (chopped), cooked beetroot (beets) in natural juice, drained and diced

50ml, 2floz, ¼ cup, red wine vinegar

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

2-3 teaspoons runny honey

80ml, 3floz, 1/3 cup, water

1 teaspoon sea salt

 

1.    Heat the oil in a sauce pan, add the sliced onion and cook over a low heat for about 10-12 minutes – stirring every now and then to make sure the onion doesn’t burn - until the onion is soft. Add the diced beetroots, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, honey, water and salt to the sauce pan and stir.

2.    Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes - until most of the liquid has evaporated. Take the sauce pan off the heat and let the jam cool down.

 

This jam will easily keep for a week if well covered and stored in the fridge.
