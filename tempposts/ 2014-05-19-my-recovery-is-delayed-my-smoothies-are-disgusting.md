# My Recovery Is Delayed, My Smoothies Are Disgusting

## 19th May 2014

Been a bit quiet around these parts.

You know when you've been sick for a while and life feels heavy? Â Bit sore. Bit tired. Bit down.

I've got a sinus infection (thanks kids!),   setting my recovery from surgery back slightly,   and requiring another dose of antibiotics. But the surgeon says that everything looks sweet up there apart from the infection. Actually I don't mean to sound up myself but he used the word 'beautiful'. My sinuses are 'beautiful'.

I'm taking the compliments where I can get them these days.

I'm embarking on a health kick,   but failing slightly at the start. My green smoothies are so bad. I just can't ever get the proportions right. I end up saying to the kids 'Just pretend like you're drinking a salad - isn't this fun?' and 'Mmmm, can you taste the basil?' I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to taste the basil. In fact maybe you aren't even supposed to add basil.

Smoothie fail.

I need to repair my guts, return to the gym, and get my mojo back. I might be a bit sporadic here for a while.

Hope you're well out there.

All nutrient-densifying, health-boosting, gut-repairing and general smoothie advice accepted with gratitude.
