# Housework and Perspective (or Shaking My Sooty Thing In The Dusthole)

## 24th October 2013

This week,   I spent some time scrubbing <del>compost</del> filth from the inside of the car. It was a fetid,   stinky job,   and I found myself with  simultaneous feelings of virtue about the current cleaning frenzy , and horror at all the slobby behaviour that had preceded it. I thought of it as 'emotional multi-tasking'.

I suspect I'm like lots of people in that I love my nest to be sparkly, welcoming and clean, but I'm too lazy to put in the amount of hard work it takes to get it there.  I clean ALL THE TIME. And yet, the house is always mocking me with  dust bunnies and precarious piles and unfolded washing. There's so many interesting things to make and do around the house, but it's so hard to get to the good stuff, what with all the grunt-work you have to wade through first.

The problem is kids: it takes an hour to repair the damage that a team of children take ten seconds to repeat. The payoff to effort mathematics of housework is very bad.  The thing is, there is no way to 'finish' the housework. It's an insatiable beast. It will never be satisfied.

This week, I've been re-reading  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507825-at-home">At Home</a> by that delightful big old teddy bear Bill Bryson. It's a delightful read, and if you love the details of domestic life, you will adore the daily jobs-list of Hannah Culwick, English servant, 1840:

<blockquote>Opened the shutters &amp; lighted the kitchen fire. Shook my sooty thing in the dusthole &amp; emptied the soot there. Swept &amp; dusted the rooms &amp; the hall. Laid the hearth &amp; got breakfast up. Clean’d 2 pairs of boots. Made the beds &amp; emptied the slops. Clean’d &amp; washed the breakfast things up. Clean’d the plate, clean’d the knives &amp; got dinner up. Clean’d away. Clean’d the kitchen up; unpack’d a hamper. Took 2 chickens to Mrs. Brewers &amp;brought the message back. Made a tart &amp; pick’d &amp; gutted 2 ducks and roasted them. Clean’s the steps and flags on my knees. Wash’d up in the scullery. Clean’d the pantry on my knees &amp; scour’d the tables. Scrubbed the flags around the house &amp; clean’d the windowsills. Got tea for the Master and Mrs. Warwick…Clean’d the privy &amp; Passage &amp; Scullery floor on my knees. Wash’d the dog &amp; clean’d the sinks down. Put the supper ready for Ann to take up, for I was too dirty &amp; tired to go upstairs. Wash’d in a bath &amp; to bed.</blockquote>

A typical day for Hannah, unusual only in that she managed a bath, unlike most days where she wrote:  ‘Slept in my dirt.’

My first thought: God, what a soft, middle class fanny I am. I would not last a second in the nineteenth century.

My second thought: Why does 'shook my sooty thing in the dusthole' sound so filthy? God, I am so vulgar. I would not last a second in the nineteenth century.

My third thought: Hannah went into service at age eight. This is terrible, or course. **Awful**. And yet...I've got a seven year old. It costs me a good ten bucks in stickers and much exhausting Wiggles-level-enthusiastic praise to get her to make her bed. Is it so wrong to take on a few ideas?

How wrong?
