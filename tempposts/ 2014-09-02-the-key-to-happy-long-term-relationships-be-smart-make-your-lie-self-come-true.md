# The Key To Happy Long-Term Relationships: Be Smart, Make Your 'Lie Self' Come True

## 2nd September 2014

Are you familiar with the incisive,   hilarious work of Dan Savage? He's a sex-and-relationship advice columnist and writer. (Listen to him <a href="http://www.savagelovecast.com/">here</a>.) Â I love Dan,   and I came across this wonderful clip via the <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a> website this week. In it,   Dan describes his key to a happy long-term relationship: accepting that there is a 'price of admission' and throwing yourself into the joy of it all.

It's good.

<blockquote>When you think about it, you meet somebody for the first time, and they're not presenting their 'warts-and-all' self to you.They're presenting their idealised selves. They're leading with their best. Right? And then eventually you're farting in front of each other. Eventually you get to see the person who is behind that facade of their best, and they get to see the person who is behind your facade. Your 'lie self'. The lie you presented to them about who you really are.

And what's beautiful about a long-term relationship, and what can be transformative about it, is that I pretend every day that my boyfriend is the lie that I met. And he does the same favour to me. He pretends that I am that better person than I actually am. Even though he knows I'm not. Even though I know he's not. And so we're obligated to live up to the lies we told each other. We are then forced to be better people than we actually are, because it's expected of us.

And you can, in a long-term relationship, really make your 'lie-self' come true. If you're smart, and you demand it, and you're willing to give.</blockquote>

It reminded me of something I heard Elizabeth Gilbert - another of my favourite people - say when interviewed on<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist/2014/08/the_gist_speaks_with_elizabeth_gilbert_about_the_signature_of_all_things.html"> The Gist podcast: </a>'You've got to love people more than they deserve, and if you're lucky you'll find someone that loves you more than you deserve too, and that way, happiness lies.'
