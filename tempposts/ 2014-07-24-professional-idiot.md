# Professional Idiot

## 24th July 2014

One of Keith's business colleagues texted me yesterday looking for Keith. They had the number of my phone and not his.

I sent them a text business card with his phone number. But he's not listed under his proper name on my phone,   he's called K-Dog My Love And Crazy Old Bastard. I only realised I had provided this unknown scientist with this strange contact after I pressed Send. I had to follow it up with the text of shame. Until that moment,   I was pulling off the illusion of businesslike professional life-partner.

Anyway, it was a nice few minutes while it lasted.
