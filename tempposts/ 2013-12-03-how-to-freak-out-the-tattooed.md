# How To Freak Out The Tattooed

## 3rd December 2013

I caught a really interesting program on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/">Background Briefing</a> recently. Journalist Ian Townsend investigated the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/epidemic-of-ink-v2/5053424">rise of tattoo popularity</a> and the potential dangers of tattoo ink. I've got a couple of little ones,   from the 90's. That was when tatts started going mainstream, says Townsend. Luckily, I didn't get any ink I regret. Just this sweet Britney portrait.

By 1998, 10% of Australian adults had one, a number that rose to 15% by 2006; and now, 30% of women in their 20's have a tattoo.

Fascinating stats.

But there's also a rising concern about the safety of tattoo inks, which have been found to contain toxins, heavy metals and potential carcinogens. In Australia, tattoo inks are imported as industrial chemicals, and thus occupy a sort of 'regulation black hole'. In addition, many people are buying home kits and cheap inks online for backyard tattooing.

Listen to the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/epidemic-of-ink-v2/5053424">full podcast here</a>. And if you're still thinking about getting ink; here are some ideas: ( all f<a href="http://worst-tattoo-ever.tumblr.com/">rom this Tumblr, </a>where I spent the best ten minutes of my day):

<p This one is for my dear friend Lucy. (I think we should do this ourselves at your 40th weekend Lu. Let's discuss. )</p>

<p And these next few will surely pass the test of time, for when Grandma's still got it,and Grandpa's just an old scamp!</p>
