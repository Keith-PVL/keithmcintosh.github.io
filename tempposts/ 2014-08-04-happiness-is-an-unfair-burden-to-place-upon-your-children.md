# Happiness Is An Unfair Burden To Place Upon Your Children

## 4th August 2014

A great TED talk from Jennifer Senior,   the author of recent book 'All Joy and No Fun', which examined the social science of modern parenting in all its anxious competitiveness.  The ultimate goal most of us aim for our children is 'happiness' - a crock, says Senior.

<blockquote>“...as Dr. Spock points out, raising happy children is an elusive aim compared to the more concrete aims of parenting in the past: creating competent children in certain kinds of work; and creating morally responsible citizens who fulfill a prescribed set of community obligations. The fact is, those bygone goals are probably more constructive--and achievable. Not all children will grow up to be happy, in spite of their parents' most valiant efforts, and all children are unhappy somewhere along the way.”</blockquote>

It's what it means to live in an age where our children are 'economically worthless, but emotionally priceless', says Senior. We are all just improvising as we go here - we've got no script. So why not let go of 'happiness' as a goal and rather help our children to be moral and productive people? If it's meant to, Senior says, 'happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do, and their accomplishments, and the love that they feel from us.'

On that note, happy Mondays to you all.
