# Hive Mind: Housework

## 13th January 2014

'I hate housework,  ' said Joan Rivers. 'You make the beds,   you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again.' I'm with Joan. The problem with housework is that it never ends. And when you are the stay-at-home primary carer,    there is no avoiding it. Children make mess faster than you can tidy it. Sometimes they even make a mess and then wee on top of it.

Some of us are better at coming to terms with housework than others. I am a natural nester,  but a shitty housekeeper. I lack the discipline to stick at the terrible mundane everyday tasks, and I constantly battle with myself over it. 'Few tasks are more like the torture of Sisyphus than housework, with its endless repetition, said Simone de Beauvoir. 'The clean becomes soiled, the soiled is made clean, over and over, day after day.'

I know that Joan, Simone and I are not alone in this. So I've called in a couple of experts to this edition of Hive Mind. Today,  Beth of <a href="http://baby-mac.com/">Babymac</a> (Australia's Martha Stewart but a <a href="http://mogantosh.com/martha-stewarts-food-photography-is-disgusting/">better food photographer)</a>, and Em from the <a href="http://www.thebeetleshack.com/">Beetleshack</a> are going to try to crack the nut of this housework dilemma.

Beth is a systems woman. She is not housework's bitch. Housework is HER bitch, dammit.

'I treat the relentless, mundane, soul destroying work as something that just has to be done, ' says Beth. '<span Like going to the bathroom, or going to sleep, or drinking water, this shit just needs to get done. You have to tackle in bursts, and NEVER, I repeat NEVER stop half way. Set yourself a quick 15 min window with a few goals in it: for me I can get all the beds made, dishes packed and breakfast cleaned up in 15 minutes. 15 minutes never killed anyone did it? Go like the clappers - a cleaning whirling dervish if you will - and then reward yourself and do nothing for a few hours. I tackle washing like this. Any one household task. You will note though, that I am mental. And OF COURSE I occasionally think I will lose my shit if a knife with vegemite is placed on the sink rather than the dishwasher for the 675th time. I'm only human, even though I may have super neat powers.' </span>

<span Also, Beth is not afraid to shout. 'I have learnt over the past 12 months or so to give warnings to all members of my family that I am nearing shout mode. It goes a bit like this: "Daisy you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 7 minutes. Daisy you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 5 minutes. Daisy and Harper you are not listening to me, you need to get dressed and Harper you need to brush your hair because we are leaving in 4 minutes. If you don't start to get dressed, I am going to get cranky and I am going to shout at you both. GET DRESSED. </span>I also swear when I am shouty. It's not good I know, but I do it. They know I am serious when the swearing begins.'

Beth, like all of us, somewhere deep inside, carries a secret shame.

'<span Cupboard Management, ' she bravely shares. 'Open any cupboard in my house and you will see shit spilling from it. I have a friend who was SHOCKED with the state of all my cupboards. If it has doors and can be shut then I don't care what happens in there. I need to work on this, except then I remember that I have a life and really cannot be fucked. I think I need to live in an open shelved house.' </span>

Beth's house in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales in Australia is gorgeous. Really gorgeous. I had to ask, because I know you want to know this too:  'Beth, you have a beautiful house, gorgeously styled. It's like homestead porn. Is this real, or a brilliant illusion that you have created while you type at your laptop in a dingy shed like the Unabomber?'

'My house actually looks like it does on the blog and Instagram ALL THE TIME,' says Beth. ' As I said, I'm mental. I like clean and neat for my state of mind - always have since I was a girl - and it's not going to change. Of course mess comes with life and we have kids, lots of visitors and entertaining so of course mess is around at times but dead set, it's usually like this. Ask any of my friends or family...just don't open the cupboards!!!'

Em from the Beetleshack - honest, warm and thoughtful -  has three small children, and she<a href="http://www.thebeetleshack.com/2013/07/the-shouty-housewife-and-weekend-dilemma.html"> wrote a post</a> last year that really resonated with me.

I call the problem 'Saturday Syndrome' - that moment, every week, when you come to terms with the fact that it might be the weekend, but you don't get a day off the bloody housework.  'Each weekend, often on a Sunday morning I find myself in the usual predicament - stressed about the state of the house,' says Em.

<br />

<div>'During the week I spend a good portion of each day tidying up. I wipe up after breakfast and put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. I cut a plate of fresh fruit for morning tea then wipe up and put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. I make the kids Vegemite sandwiches for lunch then wipe up and put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher. My days are punctuated by spray and wipe sessions and you know, it's kind of got a nice rhythm about it. It's work and I'm okay with that.'</div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>'Yet on a subconscious level I expect the weekends to be different. I secretly think that maybe someone else will sort the washing and wipe the wee from the toilet seat and the floor. So when I leave my coffee cup next to the bed, my breakfast plate on the table and my pj's next to the shower, It's with a jolt of surprise that I find them still sitting there waiting for me.What? Don't they know it's the weekend? It would appear not.'</div>

<div></div>

<div></div><br />

<div>Em tells it like it is:  relentless. 'Look, I'm just going to come out and say it. I'm over it. I'm over the mess, the noise, the wet beds (theirs not mine), the sleepless nights, the crying, the fluff balls down the hall and the mess - oh have I said that already? I'm SO over the mess.  I'm over the week days, the weekends and especially the long weekends. I'm over the washing and the cooking. I'm over the bickering, the whinging the negotiation, the mediation. I'm over the wee that always seems to be on the bathroom floor.'</div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>Me too Em.</div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div></div>

<div>Family life is chaotic and messy and wonderful. I love our little home, I cook and I clean all day long, and I have great respect for the crafts of the homestead - cooking, making, repairing, mending. But I dream of  coming to a calmer, more organised and disciplined place with the 'work' of the house. Basically I really want to be <a href="http://down---to---earth.blogspot.com.au/">Rhonda </a>when I grow up. Okay, with a touch of Beth. And Lily Tomlin.And Larry David.

I digress. </div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div>Thanks Em and Beth for your honesty, wit and charm.</div>
