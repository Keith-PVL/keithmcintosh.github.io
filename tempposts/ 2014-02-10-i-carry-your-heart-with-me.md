<div i carry your heart with me (i carry it in</div>

<div>my heart) i am never without it (anywhere</div>

<div>i go you go,  my dear; and whatever is done</div>

<div>by only me is your doing,   my darling)</div>

<div>                                                      i fear</div>

<div></div>

<div>no fate (for you are my fate,  my sweet) i want</div>

<div>no world (for beautiful you are my world,my true)</div>

<div>and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant</div>

<div>and whatever a sun will always sing is you</div>

<div></div>

<div>here is the deepest secret nobody knows</div>

<div>(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud</div>

<div>and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows</div>

<div>higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)</div>

<div>and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart</div>

<div></div>

<div>i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)</div>
