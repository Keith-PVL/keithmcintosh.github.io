Have you ever heard the phrase 'Make-up is an apology for your actual face?' I love that. As I roll into my forties, I'm having trouble keeping up with the level of grooming that seems to be required of me to stay respectable. The post-millenial female appearance apparently requires shiny, styled hair, smooth legs, tidy bush, nice tan, tamed eyebrows, good nails and more. I'm not even entering some crazy world of anal bleaching, vajazzling or complicated make-up routines. Just the basics. I'm with Miranda Hart on this one.

<blockquote>If taking oneself seriously as a woman means committing to a life of grooming, pumicing, pruning and polishing one’s exterior for the benefit of onlookers, then I may as well heave my unwieldy rucksack to the top of a bleak Scottish hill and make my home there under a stone, where I’ll fashion shoes out of mud.</blockquote>

I love clothes, and I like to look nice, but I often fail to pull myself together. And as my face shows the years more and more, I can see that striving to look young and put-together is a bit of a losing race; a battle I can't win, and one that is sure to make me feel sad. Nope, as I sit with a pair of undies holding back my frazzled mane, and contemplate dealing with the hairs that  have taken to sprouting from my chin,  I am deciding that I will just enjoy looking at the woman that are more stylish than I am, and adopt Anne Roiphe's approach for myself:  'A woman whose smile is open and whose expression is glad has a kind of beauty no matter what she wears.'
