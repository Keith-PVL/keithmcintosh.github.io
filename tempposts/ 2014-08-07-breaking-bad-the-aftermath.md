# Breaking Bad: The Aftermath

## 7th August 2014

Keith and I just Â finished watching the final season of Breaking Bad. It got so stressful at times I thought I was going to have a minor heart attack. One friend told me that she just kept saying 'I can't breathe. I can't breathe...' and another advised me to buy some adult nappies.

It's taken us a few years to get through the whole thing because we needed long breaks between seasons.I feel the same about Game Of Thrones. I love it,   but it kills me. We were watching the latest season after I had sinus surgery recently. There I was,   blood running down the back of my throat, face throbbing, holding Keith's hand and whimpering 'No, no. No torture the baby...' I drew the line.

I'm a Borgen girl. A good hit of Scandi political drama and I am happy for days. No need for adult nappies or preparatory Quaaludes. My mother-in-law just sent me 'Miss Selfridge' which looks like it has a British Mad Men vibe. Anyway, after that last lot of Breaking Bad, Keith and I have decided that we will watch nothing but sunshine and unicorns until 2015. Care Bears is a good start, he thinks. Lots and lots of Care Bears.

What are you watching? Talk to me about Borgen.
