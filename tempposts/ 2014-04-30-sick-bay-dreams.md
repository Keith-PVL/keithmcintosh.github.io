<p Dancing with balloons,   <a href="http://europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/ark__12148_btv1b90507129.html?start=4&amp;query=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22French+National+Library+-+Biblioth%C3%A8que+Nationale+de+France%22&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=TYPE:IMAGE&amp;qf=photograph&amp;rows=24">California,   1933</a></p>

Bad sleep last night. Blood running down the back of your throat is not conducive to sweet slumber. Just FYI.  Today,   I can't wait for the surgeon to pull these little plastic bad boys out from inside my head. Good times indeedy! I am actually really looking forward to it. Here's what else I'm looking forward to in the short, medium and long term after I exit this sickbed:

Roasting a chicken.

Making French coffee-custard desserts.

Cooking up a new batch of soap.

Sewing some couch cushions.

Painting the bathroom cabinets.

Singing around the piano.

Rewriting my menu.

Getting back into the swing of after school study-projects.

Early morning wake-ups to write in the quiet.

A haircut.

Family dance parties.

School drop-off.

Painkiller-free cognitive processing.

Listening to podcasts on the gym treadmill.

Daydreaming about building a parents retreat with outdoor bath.

Daydreaming about building a conservatory kitchen full of potted trees.

Days without pain.

Life, lovely life.
