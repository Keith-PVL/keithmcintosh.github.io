# Poo In The Bath and Other Moments At Home

## 2nd June 2014

1. It was just yesterday that I said to Keith 'Gee,   we haven't had a poo in the bath for a long time.' Well played,   karmic indignity, I thought tonight as I disinfected my happy place.* Nicely done. Karmic indinity load compounded increased when I remembered that I had a Picnic Bar set aside to eat in the bath tonight. Could it be worse?

2. Recently T-Bone said to me 'When Daddy is dead, let's put the cover of Plants Versus Zombies' on his gravestone. I was moved. Honours come no higher than this.

Georgie set off a video that played 'poo, poo, poo, poo, poo'. This is the curretn soundtrck to my existence. 'Squueezy yogurt poo' got a run today. 'Mummy poo' etc

3. Cooked barramundi with a lemon beurre blanc this week  and the children were licking their plates. My feeders heart was so very happy.

3. truth or dare chili etc

3. Two-year-old Pudding experiences every emotion with full-bodied commitment. Last week, on the way home from Nanna and Pop's house, she was wracked with heartbroken sobs because she realised that she had forgotten to reply 'Don't forget your toilet paper' to Pop's 'see ya later, alligator.'

*this is not a euphemism for the white-wine-vinegar vinegar douche I give my lady garden every Saturday night. I promise never to be coy when I do get around to a full tutorial on this.
