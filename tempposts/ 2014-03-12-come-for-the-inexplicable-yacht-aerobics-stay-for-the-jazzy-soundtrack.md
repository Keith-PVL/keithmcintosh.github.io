# Come for the Inexplicable Yacht Aerobics Stay for the Jazzy Soundtrack

## 12th March 2014

Just.

Because.

Where is Jaclyn Zeman now? I know one thing. She is definitely favouring that right leg,   bending it back and forward, up and down, in and out.  I don't blame her -  if I had done such a damn fine job trimming the downstair shedges I may too have wanted to display my work, like an extroverted, water-loving baboon.

But I fear that if Jaclyn kept favouring one leg over the other she is now lurching about the place; one massive muscled thigh and one small wizened twig-leg.  Turning in circles, forever and ever. Extremely dangerous on a yacht.
