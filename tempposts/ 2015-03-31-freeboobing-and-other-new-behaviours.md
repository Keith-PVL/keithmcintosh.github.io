# freeboobing and other new behaviours

## 31st March 2015

My lord! It seems that ‘freeboobing’ is a thing. This,   the art of letting the ladies fly free, is a skill I have perfected – seconds after I walk in the door, the bra is off and I can relax. I remember once I realised how habitual the bra-flinging had become when my mum and dad were over for dinner. Next to Dad, mid-anecdote, I threaded my bra out of the sleeve of my shirt and threw it over to join the rest of the washing on the lounge.

All class, me.

But now it has a name, and a cool name too. Totes cutty-edgy.

#freeboobing.

Freeboobing for the win!

It got me thinking. What else is there that is happening in my life that I never knew was a trend? Have I been on the cutting edge of fashion this WHOLE TIME?

What about #bathslobbing, where I soak in my own discarded skin cells for an hour? I am seriously good at that.

What about #nobbysinging, where I sing Streisand or Broadway tunes to my children with full commitment to the dramatic arc of the song and every power note it holds, and I know from their guileless little faces that they don’t yet realise how terrifyingly  daggy this is?

(This also applies to #cooldancing.).

What about #rabbitholing, when hours that could have been spent learning more/something about Middle Eastern politics or cleaning the bathroom were spent in a fruitless, addictive ugly quest to understand what a Freelee the Banana Girl is.

#hotpantsing, when my legs are too hairy for shorts on a hot day

#honestchilding when the kids are the only ones telling the truth, as in ‘Mum are you growing a beard?’ or ‘you still look like there’s a baby in there’.

What about #anychocolating when there is no actual chocolate left in the house and one has to resort to making icing or eating Milo from the tin with a spoon?

What about ALL TOGETHER? Last night I spent #freeboobing while #rabbitholing and #anychocolating.

Finally, my hour has come!
