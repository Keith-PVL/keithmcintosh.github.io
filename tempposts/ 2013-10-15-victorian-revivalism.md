# Victorian Revivalism

## 15th October 2013

This week,   my favourite listening experience has been this episode of BBC4's Start The Week on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c2zvk">Victorian revivalism. </a>

I love the aesthetic of this neo-Victorian fashion trend.  Steampunk,with its blend of the modern and the anachronistic, is beautiful and strange.

<p Full beards, Grandpa haircuts, taxidermy, cluttered interiors, vaudeville, beautiful signage: they please me. Old-timey barbers and curiosity cabinets are everywhere. It's an interesting trend.  But how come? Why are we so interested in this pre-Freudian time, where even piano legs were shrouded because of their saucy connotations?</p>

<p Perhaps because we are so saturated these days with Miley's tongue and everything it stands for,  repression and taboo have become the counterculture.</p>

<p In any case, this is a great podcast; a fine way to spend 45 minutes cleaning the kitchen or undercoating your next interiors project. (Hot pink and orange are go!)</p>

<p ps - The big daddy is home, the band is back together, all is balanced once again in the Mogantosh ranch.  Huzzah!</p>
