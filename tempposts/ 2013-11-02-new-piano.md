# New Piano!

## 2nd November 2013

The family band is about to take on a whole new sound after we took delivery today of a shiny new piano.

I can't play anything except the theme tune to A Country Practice. But the K Dog plays beautifully and is teaching the big two. He is so in love with this bad boy that he can't quite pass it without sitting down and having a play.

Much plinky plonky music from our house over the next while I think.Â I can't wait to belt out a little Angel Of the Morning and other hot hits of the moment.

Happy days!
