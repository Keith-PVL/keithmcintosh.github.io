# The Packer Whacker: I Can't Help It I Love It

## 6th May 2014

Relating to Jamie P this morning,   both feeling like we'v been punched in the face.

Something so australian,   egalitarian about it. Everybody seems just delighted by it. The absurdity of it. oF course voilence is never the answer. But two mega-rich fat cats having a classic old-man fight on the street? HILARIOUS.

Reminded me immediately of the classic missdle0aged man fight from Bridget Jones' diary.

i hope it will have a negative impact on his gambling businesses.

add vidoe.

Me,   out and about for the first time; driving, had a coffee, did th shopping. Teds version of 'helping mummy' was getting out of the car, lying down on the footpath and refusing to move. I tried to pull him up as leftover water from my nasal rinsing streamed down my sleeve.(Classy!) Luckily my friend Jen came along and hauled him into school. She also looked after the little one yesterday and made us dinner, and I am almost positive she's not waiting outside my house now to punch me in the nose.

Choose your friends more carefully Jamie!

Also, stop augmenting our fortune through the miseries of others.

Hope your nose feels better soon.
