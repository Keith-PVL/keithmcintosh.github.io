# Interesting People: Sarah-Jane Saznak (Mum, Quadriplegic and Determined Warrior)

## 2nd Whoops 2014

In November of 2013,   Sarah-Jane Staznak underwent surgery to repair a bulging disc in her neck. She awoke from that surgery a quadriplegic,   and has spent the last year in intensive rehabilitation,   coping with both the physical and the emotional aftermath of what has happened to her.

Meet SJ. She's pretty amazing.

*SJ,  you have done some really incredible stuff in your life, like cycling around Australia, ** South America and various parts of the world, as well as working as a Cross Country  **Skiing, Rock Climbing and Canyoning Instructor. Let’s just say that you have not **been a couch potato. Can you tell us a story from one of your adventures? ** What was the biggest challenge you faced in life before this massive bastard you’re **dealing with now?*

Towards the end of my eighteen-month long cycling journey around Australia ( we did a Figure 8 on a pushy), I was heading up to Cape York on a rough corrugated road full of dust in a bad headwind.We’d been on the road for sixteen months, it was so hot and it was so challenging to put  one foot in front of the other to reach the tip of Australia. I kept plugging away but I was spent. My partner was way ahead and it was, I think, the first time in my life I just lost it. I remember I threw my bike down on the ground and ran off into the bush and screamed with exhaustion.

**If  it’s not too painful to talk about, what do you remember about waking from the surgery? Did it take some time to understand or believe what had happened to you?**

I woke up to hear the voice of this little registrar saying 'The surgery went well.'  And then he was getting me to wiggle my toes and then I couldn't sit up. He had no manner appropriate for the moment, and I started to panic and he started saying shit like 'On wow, this is bad, I haven't seen this before...'  And then I ended up in emergency with a massive hemorrhage in my spinal cord.

After that I have very little recollection. I had so many anxiety attacks in that period - I thought I had some experience with anxiety but they were different - really, really intense. In those first few weeks I was in a bit of denial – I was happy, had really intimate relationships with the staff, and I was pumped full of steroids, and I kept thinking 'OK, once these steroids kick in, it will be fine...'  But as it became a reality, it was tough. They tell you these benchmarks: after  3 weeks, this. After 6 weeks, this. Each time you reach one it's terrible. I was a basket-case really.  It's all a bit of a blur.

**A year on, do you feel that your shock and grief is at a different stage? **

Grief is right. I have times I struggle with 'I'm never going to ski again - I love to dance, and I'm never going to dance again.' I suppose I've gone through all the stages of grief.  I even became quite close to the surgeon, in the early days and weeks. In one encounter we both cried and I told him 'You have to let this go.'  I  understand that shit happens. I haven't seen him since those early weeks though, and I'm advised not to have contact with him now.

**SJ, you had an extremely active life before that surgery. Do you think that your fitness has stood you in good stead for the rigours  of rehabilitation?**

It's beginning to. Really, I've spent the majority of this year dealing my with mental health.  It's a year next week since my surgery, and I'm starting to get my head in the place where I can tap into that. Now I can feel my body kicking back in. At the minute I am working on a stationery bike. I lie there and talk to my legs, tell them 'Come on, you've  done this. You know what to do.'

**SJ, are you a person that relies on black humour? Have you ever, in all the stress and trauma, had those ridiculous moments where you just have to laugh?**

Oh my god yes, definitely. I don't know so much about having to laugh, but  I remember there was one time when they moved me from my room to one room down and I was lying in bed and the buzzer had dropped to the ground. I was completely unable to move and I couldn't call out because at that time I couldn't breathe well,and I had all these sinus problems. And I told myself 'OK, I can either have an anxiety attack, or  stay calm, and just accept this moment.'

I mean, I've has so many bowel accidents that in the end I have to laugh. At the start I cried,  but now I have to laugh, or I'd  be a basket case.

**Sometimes people talk about a ray of sunshine in the shit where, when faced with trauma and struggle, you realise what love and support you have around you.  Have you experienced that?**

Oh my god, yes. In a less broken phase I used to think 'At the end of all this there's a big gold nugget'. Now what I have to keep reminding myself is that there are little gold nuggets along the way. For example, I've always thought that my Dad is a wonderful man, but he's been so compassionate and amazing. Plus, I live in the most amazing community – so helpful, so kind. I've always been really social, and I feel like I've been a bit of a magnet to bring people together, so it's kind of come to bite me on the arse in the best possible way! But I am having to learn to receive and receive and not give back, which is one of the hardest things for me. But  I don't have any choice at the moment.

** SJ, you've got a 5 year old son, Hamish. How have you coped with the busy emotional intensity of mothering a small child along with all the huge psychological life-shift you’ve had to undertake?   How has Hamish coped? **

Oh, it's been tough. Me and Hamish's dad separated a week before  the surgery, and Hamish and I had such a special relationship, he was so close to his Mum. I was his person. But after 7 months in rehab I felt like I came home as a stranger into my own home. Instead of 'Mum, canI...?' it's 'Dad, Dad, Dad.'  The loss of that mother role, and the grief of losing that relationship that we had, and having to reestablish a relationship ship that’s not the same, and having to accept that it will never be the same, and stop grieving for what it could be - that's probably the hardest part about it.

But Hamish is the most gorgeous 5 year old. Sometimes I'll melt down in front of him – and I'm  upfront with him about stuff -  and he's so helpful, he'll help with my catheter bag or push my wheelchair. He's becomes a lot more independent. Now, he can sit on my lap in the electric chair and I can take him to school, which I love. That's what I really want to be able to do, stuff like take him to school.

**SJ,  you are trying to raise about $300, 000 to go to America for therapy, and to buy equipment that you need.  Can you tell us a little about the therapy, tools and equipment you are hoping to raise funds for? And how can people help you raise those funds? **

I need equipment that’s specialised. I'd like to be able to do more cardio – my physical and mental health is so much better when I'm being active, but I'm going to need to set up my own rehab gym and that equipment is so expensive. The program in the USA is an intensive spinal rehabilitation program that runs for between three and six months. It breaks my heart to leave Hamish again for that time but I have to think of it as an investment in our future together. The big picture is to get as good as I can get to be more functional as a parent. And also, I want him to see and remember that his mum and be proud of his mum and how strong she was and how hard she fought.

**Thanks SJ! For me, the  phone conversation I had with you is one of life's 'little gold nuggets'.  What an inspiring, eloquent and thoughtful woman. I wish you all the best for your future and I hope some of my wonderful readers - so many of us mothers of small kids like you - are able to help with your fundraising efforts. **
