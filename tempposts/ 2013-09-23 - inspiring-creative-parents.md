# Inspiring Creative Parents

## 23rd September 2013

A cool dude named <a href="http://wandermonster.com/">Rob Kimmel</a> has been making art with his son every day since the boy was in kindergarten. Rob sends a post-it note half drawn to school in his sons lunch,   and the kid completes it. <a href="http://vimeo.com/30267147">This video</a> explains their collaborative tradition. It's very cool.

Another artist Mica Angela Hendricks <a href="http://io9.com/artist-collaborates-with-her-four-year-old-daughter-an-1241348532">collaborates with her four-year-old</a> to create wonderful,   unexpected images. Mica was reluctant at first. Who wants grubby toddler fingers on the good art supplies? But her daughter cannily turned the tables.  “If you can’t share,  ' Mica's daughter said, 'we might have to take it away.'

The results were gorgeous, and the duo have developed a system.

<p  Mica begins the drawing and then her daughter takes the image wherever her pre-preschoolers heart desires.</p>

I'm inspired.

I really love the idea of making something together with the small ones, rather than setting up activities and taking advantage of the calm to tackle something else on my neverending list.  Today, the first day of the school holidays, I set up the craft table as usual, but instead of pottering around the kitchen and interacting from a distance, I sat down and joined in. The kids picked a bunch of flowers from the garden and we did some flower studies in pen and pencil and watercolour while the baby slept. Six year old Peanut zoned in on the detail of her flowers.

Five year old T-Bone  (currently my nutcase-in-residence), added collage and text to his picture, asking me to write in boxes 'Happy birthday' and 'Yeah man!' Why? Who knows. Why not?

Flower art. It was a lovely time. Tomorrow I think I'll cook up a bunch of<a href="http://sustainableecho.com/homemade-natural-glue/"> this paste</a> (it lasts for weeks) and then empty the recycling box and the magazine rack onto the table.  See what happens.

For more crafty ideas, Em at the Beetle Shack has an excellent <a href="http://www.thebeetleshack.com/2013/07/holiday-craft-ideas.html">post on holiday craft</a>, and the <a href="http://www.artfulparent.com/arts-and-crafts-directory.html">archives at The Artful Parent</a> are full of treasure, including ideas to inspire creativity in little ones.
