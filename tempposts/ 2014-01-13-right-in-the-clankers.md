# Right In The Clankers!

## 13th January 2014

Fierce game of Battleship tonight. Keith and Peanut thrashed young T-Bone and I. I may have accidentally set the board up a bit wrong and messed with the outcome,   but I still played better than my 5 year old partner,   who kept whispering 'Just keep moving the bits around, Mum!' and 'Why don't we just lie about where our bits are?'

Keith is I take different approaches to the game. He and Peanut whisper complex strategy, while T-Bone and I just wait for the moments when we get hit and we can do dramatic death-acting, or when we make contact with their boats and T shouts 'Right in the clankers!'

Later, we might catch a bit of Veep, our new favourite show. Keith and I are between seasons of Breaking Bad, and needing a little light relief. Julia Louis Dreyfuss as the Vice President is a comic genius, and if you're an Arrested Development fan, you will love Buster playing the VP's 'bag-man', in all his MotherBoy glory.

Every time I put on my glasses now, I think about Julia calling them a sign of weakness. 'Like wheelchairs for the eyes.'

I'm buckling in for a busy week ahead here at Ranch Mogantosh. We've got school holidays, sleepover visitors, an irrepressible toddler (Watcha my dance Mama! Watcha my sing Mama! Watcha my poo, Mama!) , and a generally full schedule of shenanigans.

I wish you all a week full of busy good times, some fine belly laughs and if at all possible, the charms of a two-year old telling knock-knock jokes. (Hint- don't answer the door. The answer is always 'Poo! HAHAHAH!)
