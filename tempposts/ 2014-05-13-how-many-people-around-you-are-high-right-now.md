# How Many People Around You Are High Right Now?

## 13th May 2014

Heaps,   according to This American Life. They're everywhere! A <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/524/i-was-so-high">great episode.</a>

More good listening for you:

My eternal girlfriend <a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/whnews/whnews_20140502-1000a.mp3">Caitlin Moran</a> on BBC 4's Woman's Hour talks about teaching her small daughter to shout 'Damn the patriarchy!' whenever she stubs her toe.

I liked this interesting exploration of the mysterious <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-gypsies-work/">history of the 'gypsies' or Roma people </a> from the charming,   laconic boys at Stuff You Should Know.

Finally, my favourite listen of the week: An<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/05/07/3999555.htm?site=conversations"> excellent interview </a>by Richard Fidler with comic Jean Kitson on le dreaded **menopause**: why the historical silence? 'If women became angry and irritable, they were locked up', says Kitson.  'But when men became angry and irritable, they were elected to Parliament. '

Go forth, my friends: wash those dishes, make those beds, drive that car to work; all while you make happy your ears.
