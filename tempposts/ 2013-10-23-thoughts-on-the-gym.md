# Thoughts On The Gym

## 23rd October 2013

Straing at that woman. Confused by big guns,   full-sleeve tatoo and fully made up face. Then thinking,   oh,   maybe roller derby...then realising I'm staring at her, pink and panting, and she must think I'm weird. Then, you wnat to be seen right? Maybe not by pink, panting middle aged women who keep dropping their headphones and stumbling awkwardly on the treadmill.

Enjoying the vibe of older women sweating.

Dreaming about the day I do the boxing class I watch. They look so hard core!

Used to yoga land, not gym land.

The outfits and the vibe are different. Yoga is neutrals. Gym is neon. Yoga is serene. Gym is high-pctane.
