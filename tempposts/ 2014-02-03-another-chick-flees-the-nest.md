# Another Chick Flees The Nest

## 3rd February 2014

<img class="photo-horiz" src="/images/2014/02/p4664-0026.jpg" />



Look at this beautiful 2007 photograph of Hazara schoolboys in Afghanistan by <a href="http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/photography/picture-galleries/2011/february/16/steve-mcurry-the-unguarded-moment/">Steve McCurry</a>. Those bright eyes. Where are those boys now,   I wonder?



 

All over the world, little ones like these are starting school this year. Today,  it was my small T-Bone's turn.

 



Off he trotted, his hat falling over his eyes, his bag packed with spare undies. I was teary and  anxious as I gave him up, even though I have been counting down the minutes until school started. This boy is so ready for school. I'm so ready for a break. But it still pangs, hurts a little, to put my small one into somebody else's hands.

 



 After I left T at school, I kept thinking about all the time I have spent recently being frustrated and snapping his name.  'T-Bone!' 'T-Bone!' 'T-Bone!' It comes out in a particular sharp cadence (a two-note phrase that that he may in fact he able to mimic perfectly to some future psychologist helping him to process his mother issues) several times a day as he flings things across the room or jumps off the couch onto the baby, or doesn't hear me ask him to do something, as he stares into space and thinks about maths and cake.



 

T-Bone was sick this weekend. It was beautiful timing actually. Just before stepping up to the challenges of big school, he had a couple of days where he really needed his mum. He's been appearing in our bed in the early hours of every morning for about six months now, but this weekend, hot with fever and slightly delirious, he woke up every hour or two to nestle in and say 'I love my Mummy.' It was so nice to hold him close and baby him a bit, knowing that in just days, 'baby stuff' would become a thing.

 



I found this piece I wrote a couple of years ago when Peanut started school.

 



<blockquote>

align="center">Peanut  has been counting down the sleeps until school starts for the last fortnight. We've been freezing lunches. Constructing charts for morning routines.  And I have been trying to not pay too much attention to the little knot of panic that seems to have taken up residence somewhere between my chest and my throat.

</blockquote>



<blockquote>These last few weeks, we’ve been living the final moments of the intimate bubble in which I've spent the last five years. A private little domestic world of babies and breastfeeding, toddlers and tantrums and toilet-training. Of wearing a track between the stove and the washing machine. Long days of baby illnesses and endless nights of broken sleep. My time spent almost entirely within these walls. This warm and wonderful and infuriating and precious place.

This nest.

Sweet firstborn Peanut is our first chick to flee. For five years, this little girl of mine has been my whole world. I have cooked for her, washed her clothes, nursed her flu’s and soothed her worries. All, I realise now, somehow preparing her for this next chapter. The part where she trots off into the yonder without me. Those beautiful little arms and legs that I have cuddled too many times to count have somehow, sneakily, grown so big that this morning they marched my little one into school. Marched her into kindy without a backwards glance at her teary, trembly mama, who stood clutching the next-biggest child just a little too tightly. All day I have been feeling ever-so-slightly sick.

Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire, said Yeats. I love this. I’m so happy for Peanut to enter a learning environment, to light that fire, to start forging her own path. I am. I feel proud of this kind, funny, interesting and clever daughter of mine and I can't wait to see what kind of mark she will make upon the world. But within me is a battle. I long to send Peanut forth to fight (and win! please, god) her battles, and at the same time I long to wrap her in my arms, pack her in my handbag and shield her from all the pain that life, and the schoolyard, can bring.

I guess the wrapping and the packing and the shielding will have to happen, from now on, outside the hours of nine and three, except for the love that I can somehow squirrel to Ivy through the medium of her lunchbox.

One down.</blockquote>

I felt this today too, my mind switching constantly over to T-Bone. Where was he now? Was he playing with anybody? Did he remember where those spare undies were? Did he need them? I missed him. The house was so quiet with just me and the toddler pottering about.

And then.

Then school pick-up arrived, and from 2.45 until dinner at six I was treated to the brain-melting shenanigans of two post-institutionalised children. T-Bone flung himself about the house like a crazed Irish Wolfhound. Peanut rolled her eyes at me so hard that she looked like a zombie.

And now I can't wait for the peace of the post-school drop off tomorrow.

Good luck, mums of new kindy kids. May we all make it through the discombobulating adjustment of first term with good humour and the minimum of drugs.
