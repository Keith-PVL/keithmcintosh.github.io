# Far From The Madding Crowd

## 21st March 2015

Well,   comrades,    it's been an intense few days around here at Ranch Mogantosh. I diverted from my usual path of light domestic comedy and entered the controversy-sphere, and to be honest, I didn't enjoy it too much. All I can see are the holes in my argument - as much I do stand by it -  and all I can imagine are angry people upset with me. I'm not so comfortable with the stoush of it all.

The one thing I'd like to stress is that I'm sure that the vast majority of people following a diet like Paleo are undoubtedly sensible, rational people who are likely finding their health improved by this choice.

It's the outliers I worry about - the vulnerable, the sick, the very young. I wish  that the 'thought leaders' of this community seemed more responsible and measured in approach. I wish I didn't feel that they had all hadn't drunk the bone-broth Kool Aid (mmm, yummy!) and were willing to stake everything - even the lives of babies - on the strength of their convictions.

There have been many messages of support and positivity from readers of this essay, which has been incredibly gratifying. Also, the comment thread on the post has been full of thoughtful and articulate perspectives. Dissent has been minimal (on this blog at least)  and I acknowledge the courage of those commenters who stepped forward to challenge my argument.

Thank you! Thank you all.

Public debate about these issues is critical in understanding the different ways in which we all choose to live,  I think. There is so much more that unites us than separates us.

But now I'm off to the mountains for a couple of days with the family. We're going to eat pizza, read books, do puzzles, play Monopoly , go bushwalking and make fart jokes.

No laptop, no TV, and a switched-off phone. Enough of being a nervous, twitching gnome worrying about stats, composing responses and imagining angry Paleo-philes on the imminent attack, coming after me with their (grass-fed - boom tish!) stakes!   I've had enough heightened online life for this week.  I'm channeling Ann Margret instead. (via <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/">Dangerous Minds</a>). I'm going to straighten my hunched shoulders, look out upon the real world and make sultry suggestions with my eyebrows.

I wish you a weekend full of love and understanding, whatever you choose to eat.
