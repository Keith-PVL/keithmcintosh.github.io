# Fall A Little In Love With Everyone You Meet It's Healthy!

## 13th November 2013

I read a wonderful article recently exploring<a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/01/28/love-2-0-barbara-fredrickson/"> the work of  psychologist  Barbara Fredrickson</a>. (Check out Brain Pickings, it's really good.) Fredrickson's reframing of traditional ideas of love into her notion of  'positivity resonance' stayed with me.

There are neurobiological mechanics at play, and what happens, Fredrickson says,  is that you share with another person (or a group) a moment of positive emotion, which in turn syncs your biochemistry and causes you to mirror positive energy back and forth between you.

<blockquote>'Perhaps counterintuitively,  love is far more ubiquitous than you ever thought possible for the simple fact that **love is connection**. It’s that poignant stretching of your heart that you feel when you gaze into a newborn’s eyes for the first time or share a farewell hug with a dear friend. It’s even the fondness and sense of shared purpose you might unexpectedly feel with a group of strangers who’ve come together to marvel at a hatching of sea turtles or cheer at a football game. The new take on love that I want to share with you is this: Love blossoms virtually anytime two or more people — even strangers — connect over a shared positive emotion, be it mild or strong.'</blockquote>

I love this notion. Those days are the best, when my smile is easy and people seem interesting and nice. I laugh with shopkkeepers and chat to passing dogs and babies.   Recently, I was waiting for my takeaway at a local coffee shop when another customer came up to pay for lunch. The barista held out the credit-card machine to her, and instead of 'Cheque or savings?" what came out of her mouth was 'Sex?'

What!

There was a momentary pause and then all three of us erupted. It was so random and fabulous. There was no dialling back from that weird brain burst. Who knew what the woman was thinking about exactly? We didn't even know each well enough to discuss the moment. But it happened, the shared laughter happened, the connection happened, and it set off some neural feel-good machinery that was real.

Positivity resonance.

S'lovely.
