# A Thick Skin and A Strong Funnybone: Young Women and Comedy

## 22nd April 2015

You've got to have a thick skin to be a woman making art these days. When people don't like you,   it's super-easy for them to go online and suggest you get raped.

To me,   there's something incredible about women in the public eye who are able to ignore  the constant hate bombs they are showered in, and continue creating. There is a certain culture of young women who have come of age in the online era, this strange new frontier in which privacy is dead, and sexism is alive and thriving, who take their own experiences and refashion them into art. They are brave and funny. They skewer the culture that they live in. Times are weird. Weird for women. Thank god for female comics.

Here are four of my favourites:

1. Lena Dunham - Lena is something of the head prefect of this new vanguard. This  <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/girls-lena-dunham-2012-4/">NY Mag profile of the first season of Girls</a> outlines why the series (now in it's four season) was so groundbreaking.

2. Desiree Akhavan - first came to the public eye with her hilarious web series Park Slope ('a show about superficial, homophobic lesbians') and has just made her first feature film **Appropriate Behaviour**. You can listen to an interview with her on the podcast <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/desiree-akhavans-breakthrough-breakup/">Death, Sex &amp; Money. </a>

3.  Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson of Broad City capture some of the true essence of female friendship in their series (which they write, produce and star in.) It is hilarious stuff- filthy, filthy, filthy, with such a sweet heart. Two excellent profiles of them: the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/id-girls">New Yorker </a>and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/the-glorious-return-of-broad-city/384405/">The Atlantic</a>.

4. Amy Schumer, one of the sharpest and most searing of the new breed of female comics, is one of my current feminist heroes. This clip, from her new season, is gold. Bums are sexy! Also, they are where the poo comes out.
