I have an eight-year old daughter,   and I am,   at times, finding parenting a rocky path lately.

<br />

<br />

My eight-year old Peanut is brilliant, funny, theatrical and I love her with the burning heat of a thousand suns. But lately, I have found myself in a battle of the  'Come back here! Do not make that face at me! **What** did you just say?' kind. I know it's a two-step that mothers and daughters always engage in, but it's really exhausting, and it's upsetting to me that it feels like our relationship has become filled with a lot of drama.

<br />

<br />

I just want a quiet life, as Humphrey B. Bear said.

<br />

<br />

And yet, it's a tough one. I am determined to stand my ground on the certain level of respect and positivity I want the kids to bring to their home. There are five of us living here, and any one of us can raise or sink the collective mood of the home with our words and behaviour. The sulkiness and moodiness (S &amp; M) factor has been rising around our place lately, and while I have compassion for it, and I try and bring tenderness to my dealing with it, it's driving me fully crackers.

<br />

<br />

I read about some <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/researchers-find-early-signs-of-puberty-common-from-age-seven-20150124-12vxgt.html">new research lately</a> that describes 'adrenal puberty' or the surge of hormones that are the prelude to the physical changes we expect to start at age eleven or so. Adrenal puberty can mark  a new phase of development affecting identity and emotional steadiness for girls.

<blockquote>...scientists are now focussing on an earlier hormonal surge that happens at about eight years of age, which they believe has significant implications for children's social and emotional well-being and also sets the stage for the main event of physical puberty a few years later.</blockquote>



<blockquote>Known as adrenarche or adrenal puberty, it has no obvious external traits - it does not, in its early stages, cause any physical changes in a child - but the hormones involved affect how children relate to their families, teachers and peers. Researchers now believe that it is a more significant time in a child's development than previously thought, which in turn may force us to rethink not only how we raise children, but also how we educate them.</blockquote>

<br />

<br />

Dr. Lisa Mundy of the Childhood To Adolescence Transition Study says that in the years preceding physical puberty, there is significant work going on for children in terms of their grappling with identity and 'social connectedness'. 'This is a huge time of change, because they're gearing up for secondary school and there's obviously a lot of worries and concerns about that," she says. "There's obviously a lot going on at a biological level as well. Their relationships with their peers, changing relationships with their families, their school, and all of this is happening at a time when their biology is really changing."

<br />

<br />

Have compassion for Peanut, I tell myself. And have compassion for yourself - while Peanut is learning how to be eight in the world - managing friendships, processing complicated information, surfing the changes - I am learning how to be the parent of an eight-year-old. Searching for reserves of patience, practicing the art of kindness. We're both figuring it out as we go along.

<br />

<br />

I'm trying to lower my expectations in many ways (she's my eldest, she definitely cops the most of the parental gaze), and above all, to relax about it all. Life with two daughters will hold some shrieking meltdowns, right? This is inevitable. Also, I've timed my menopause to coincide nicely with Peanut's puberty so we'll get it all out of the way over a couple of high-octane years. Keith might want to book his round-the-world cruise now, to get those early-bird discounts...

<br />

<br />

In fact, Keith is very good at calming my occasional stress meltdowns about it all. It's a long game, he reminds me. It's all fine. They are who they are, and everything's OK. You're a great Mum, she's a great kid. Move along, folks. Nothing to see here. I also like to remind myself of that comforting fact that <a href="http://mogantosh.com/dont-worry-stressed-enraged-and-weeping-parents-your-kids-will-give-you-a-million-chances-to-do-better/">children will give us a million chances to do better. </a>

<br />

<br />

My plan is to spend some time focusing on the stuff that Peanut and I like to do together (baking, sewing, reading, watching Operation Ouch) and  to get some lovely calm togetherness in the bank to draw on when I feel like the 'Get back here! What did you just say to me?' is taking over. I love this little firecracker of mine. Just as long as she stops **taking that tone with me.**

Are you currently, or have you raised an eight-year old? Got any tips/Xanax prescription pads for me?
