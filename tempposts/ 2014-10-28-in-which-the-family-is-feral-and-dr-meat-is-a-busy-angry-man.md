# In Which The Family Is Feral and Dr Meat is a Busy, Angry Man

## 28th October 2014

Blog silence brought to you by man-flu,   sore backs,   towering laundry piles,    travelling husbands, wet beds, kid birthdays, power blackouts (especially hilarious when the fan on the composting toilet stops working!)  Slapped Cheek virus, head lice, worming tablets, caffeine, Nurofen Plus and Too Much Information.

Here are K and I dressed as the Ugly Stepsisters for Peanuts book-themed 8th birthday party. I am channeling 'ugly' much more than Keith is and I'm not thrilled about it. I have a monobrow and a square head, whereas Keith just looks like a ritzy party girl who's probably wearing a lacy nylon g under his leopard skinnies, and a cheeky vajazzle under that.

Pudding's newest imaginary friend is Dr Meat. He's angry. He treats all her stuffed toys for ticks, but he doesn't like Cauliflower, because of how often she says 'poo poo'. I get it! Dr. Meat is a busy man. He can't be dealing with Cauliflowers naughty word bullshit when Peanut Butter, Dodo, Puppy and Olivia Dog just keep getting infested, over and over. Plus Dodo keeps having sleepovers at his office which I'm sure is against some sort of Health Department regulation.

I'm not going to report Dr. Meat though. I'm too busy trying to keep the family one step above feral on the domestic scale.

(Just quietly, failing.)

Still!

Could be worse. I could be Robbie Williams wife in labour, frinstance.

How's things with you guys? Every family is this gross, right?

Right?

Right?

ps - we just lost power on the water pump. No water.

No water!

What fun!
