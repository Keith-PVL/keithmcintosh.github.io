# 'Gogo's Bra Fell Off' And Other Tall Tales from Toddlers

I live with a two-year-old (I call her Pudding when I write about her). Pudding often ropes me into her imaginary games. ‘Come inna my room Mama,’ she demanded recently, thrusting a plastic bowl into my hands. ‘Here your dwum! Bang it!’ I was confused, but did as I was told. Pudding put on her ‘dancing’ hat. ‘Now sing!’ she shouted.  ‘There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Doolan was his name,’  I began obediently. (Why? I don’t know why. I was on the spot. ) Pudding cavorted about the room happily for a verse or so, and then she plucked the bowl from my hands. ‘Now get out,’ she said. Alrighty then. I returned to the washing-up.

I know my place in Pudding’s pecking order. As a parent, I exist as the sun she revolves around, a fixed and steady object for her to practice her growing life-skills upon. She strikes out into independence, testing out the unknown boundaries of the world beyond me, little bit by little bit.  It’s my job, as I see it: starting from the absolute envelope of the womb, I send my kids out into the world a step at a time- steps getting bigger, safety net smaller, until eventually they won’t need me at all. (Sob!)

At the minute, small Pudding is making sense of her world through comedy and theatre, and I love it.

Is there any greater part of parenthood than watching your children create, perform, crack jokes, sing and dance? For me, the free-associating imaginary play of childhood is one of  the most wonderful parts of this whole gig.

Having little Pudding around is such a joy. She makes up songs and dances and when cuddled, she wraps her square little feet and chubby legs around me like a monkey. She processes everything that happens in her life through the creative vehicle of her stuffed toy Gogo. Gogo fell over. Gogo went to Nanna’s house. Gogo got a scrape on her leg.

In fact, Gogo is a massive party animal, constantly throwing Animal-House style blowouts. Somebody is always getting hit in the face, the doc-doc is always being called and once, memorably, Gogo’s bra fell off. ( Now *that* was a party.) Doc-docs are in fact very popular with Pudding. ‘Mama, a dinosaur bit my arm.  I haffa go doc doc,’ If I don’t respond, she ups the drama. ‘So many animals and a duck have bit my arm! Mum, I really haffa go doc doc.’ And then of course, ‘It was at Gogo’s party they bite me!’

Sometimes Pudding pretends to be an angry man who hates tomatoes. (This is just as funny as it sounds.) She negotiates ‘Jussa litta bit’ for everything she is denied, and when ‘jussa litta bit’ doesn’t work, she tries ‘juss fibe minulls.’ She likes to steal my glasses, put them on and pretend to take photos with her ‘phone.’ She wears three dresses at a time. When life doesn’t go her way, Pudding makes a face we call The Angry Bulldog, and when she’s happy, she likes to call me ‘Mummy Darling’ like a very small Real Housewife. She's just a delight in every way.

Sometimes we focus a lot on the hard work of raising a toddler, and that’s true, it’s a lot of grind. But it’s also the most wonderful thing to witness – a baby, before your eyes, taking in and making sense of the world around them, and where they fit in it. It’s absurdist and hilarious and profound.  As Mum, sometimes I’m the audience, and sometimes I’m the co-star, but whatever part I’m playing, I really think it’s the greatest show on Earth.
