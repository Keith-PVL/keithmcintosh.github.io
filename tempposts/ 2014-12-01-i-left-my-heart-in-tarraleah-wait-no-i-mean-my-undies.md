# I Left My Heart in Tarraleah Wait, No I Mean My Undies

## 1st December 2014

The family spent the weekend as guests of Tarraleah,   but all opinions are my own.

In the middle of Tasmanian; halfway between Hobart and the wilder west coast draws of Strahan and the Franklin River,   there is a little town called Tarraleah. We stayed there this weekend so I could attend a Christams cooking course at their Wildside Cooking School (more on this tomorrow.)

Tarraleah was a bustling hydro-electric town in the 20's and 30's, then a virtual ghost town until it was bought up in 2004 and renovated into a wilderness resort that's hard to describe. It's quirky. It's got resident highland cattle and a Pleasantville-esque string of gorgeously restored 1920's cottages, decorated with teak furniture and thoughtfully curated knick knacks and built, in our case at the Superintendents Cottage, on a grand scale.

It was a beautiful house to stay in; clean and airy but full of Â history. The two littles loved sharing a room and judging from the hidden evidence discovered in the eight year old's queen-bed suite, Peanut spent the weekend luxuriously reading Jeffrey Archer and eating sugar packets. That's about as good as life gets.

I adored this sun drenched breakfast room where we ate all our meals. We had such nice weather that there was no chance to use the fireplace, but it does snow at Tarraleah occasionally.

A little of the decor. And note to self: arrange face next time.

There is neither mobile phone nor Internet access at Tarraleah village. It all adds to the retro vibe. In fact we all spent some time engrosssed in the 1965 Encyclopeidia Britannica over the fireplace. Cause we know how to party. I was visiting Tarraleah to check out their Wildside Cooking School (more on this tomorrow), but after I finished cooking, we all had a spa in the clifftop hot tub.

It was not, perhaps, as relaxing as it might be for a couple celebrating their anniversary with a bottle of champagne, what with the three small children pretending to be Santa
