Recently the K-Dog and I decided give the family a ‘screen break.’  No mobile phone,   no computer,   no TV and no electronic games, we decided, like a pair of grumpy Fun Sheriffs.   If people needed us, they could ring on ye olde lande-line.

This experiment worked out great for the kids, but in truth, it impacted more on me. Here’s what I’d like to do with my spare time: pickle beetroot, make my own soap, paint the bedroom, write a book. But faced with real actual time, I jump onto Facebook, check out Twitter, read blogs and news sites and online magazines, and pin kids activities and interior design projects that I will never get time to complete. I don’t have time to pickle beetroot because I have spent too long pinning beetroot pickling tutorials. (For shame!) Instead of calming and relaxing in my down-time, I’m letting my monkey mind pull me helplessly down rabbit holes on Wikipedia and YouTube, downloading science and culture podcasts, binging on information. What did people eat in 70s communes? How do you make a macrame plant-holder? What is a bunga-bunga party, exactly? I'm living life, as they say, an inch deep and a mile wide.

Without electronics, the world got quieter. There was no little bird-chirp that alerted me to a text, no chatter in my ear from my beloved radio programs, no squeaky, hideously catchy kids show chorus to ear-worm my dreams. In fact, we play music through the laptop, off limits under the new rules, so there was no music at all, save for a little piano practice.

My window of interests shrank down to our four walls, the five of us, and the everyday ebb and flow of routine. There was no intrusion from other lives. I didn’t update my blog. Nobody cared. I didn't visit Facebook. Nothing happened. In the hours that opened up, we played more games, read more books, had more naps.

There were tough moments. Specifically, it was painful to be unable to buy time with the beloved babysitter TV, reliably there for those pre-dinner periods when the kids are all over the place like a madwoman’s washing and my patience tanks are empty. At those times, switching the button that turns three energetic, noisy kids into dull-eyed, slack-jawed zombies feels like magic. Sometimes the noise was crazy-making. But more often, the quiet was unexpectedly rich and beautiful. It made me realise how rare, and how lovely, the quiet was.

When we allowed technology to return, it was a blast, perfectly timed with a gastro bug that required me to spend many hours nursing kids on the rocking chair, zoning out to cooking shows and Peppa Pig. It was thrilling to listen to a new episode of my favourite podcast while cooking dinner, blissful to curl up with Keith on the couch and watch Game Of Thrones, and wonderfully entertaining to catch up on life in Facebook-land.

A screen-free break gave us a chance to stop and be still together as a family, in the rapid, stimulating whirlpool of modern life that doesn't leave us much chance to be bored, or even quiet. It’s something we will be trying to do regularly, I think. And one of these days, I swear, I will even pickle some beetroot.

(And on a side note, if you;re interested in the topic, I loved the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Winter-Our-Disconnect-Technology/dp/1585428558">The Winter of Our Disconnect</a>, by Susan Maushart; the funny and thought-provoking journey of  a fully-wired family pulling the plug on all technology for three months.)
