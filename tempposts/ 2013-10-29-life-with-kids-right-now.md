# Life With Kids: Right Now

## 29th October 2013

From 2 year old as she watches me work my neti pot: That's escusting! That's escusting!

From 5 year old,   to both parents: When I grow up, I will have a useful job. Not like a scientist or a writer.

From 7 year old, in front of school mum I don't know very well: Mum, Why do you say 'fuck' and 'shit' all the time? (this joke got such a good reaction that she did it again, the next day.
