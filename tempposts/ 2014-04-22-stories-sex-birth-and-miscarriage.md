# Stories: Sex, Birth and Miscarriage

## 22nd April 2014

Oh,   yes,   hello. Are you well? I'm home from our busy Easter. Settling in for a lengthy session of unpacking,   cleaning, washing and preparing for hospital on Thursday.

Three great long-form reads for you today.

Happy reading!

1.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/04/cheryl_strayed_s_true_birth_story_a_43_hour_labor_and_then_love.html">The Lavender Room</a> - a true birth story from Cheryl Strayed, author of Wild.

<blockquote>It went on. And on and on and on. All through the day and deep into the night. I laughed. I cried. I despaired. I pondered the possibility of going to a hospital and getting a C-section or at least an epidural. I resolved to stick it out so long as my baby was okay. I remembered to feel grateful. I told dirty jokes. I swore. I surrendered. I begged the spirit of my mother to come to me and help and she did. I refused to do another lunge or to get into the tub. I was ravaged and exhausted. I was blown away and forever altered. Aware of physical capacities and spiritual realms I hadn’t known existed before. I went to the deepest place within me and found there was a place deeper still. I drifted off to sleep on the bed in the Lavender Room, and woke every few minutes with a roar. I pushed so long and hard I didn’t know what I was pushing anymore—my baby’s body or mine. We merged most profoundly in the panting moment that he ripped my flesh open as I forced him into the world.</blockquote>

2. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/18/131118fa_fact_levy?currentPage=all">Thanksgiving in Mongolia </a>- a moving, beautiful personal story of miscarriage from Ariel Levy. (You might not want to read this story if you have a raw experience of pregnancy loss. It is graphic.)

3. <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/07/texting-exes-social-media-generation.html">All My Exes Live In Texts </a>- fascinating article on what the youngsters get up to these days.  **Seckshually**. And how social media has profoundly changed how we relate with our exes, making them part of our 'permanent present.'

<blockquote>Like “dialing” a cell phone or “filming” a digital video, “one-night stand” is an anachronism. Even if you only have sex once, you will spend time with your hookup when he finds you on Facebook, appears in a mutual friend’s Instagram, or texts about a weird bump he found on his penis. Older generations didn’t have a word for this kind of thing—they couldn’t have. But these are, in fact, relationships. Even casual dates have expansive biographies to plow through and life narratives you can follow for years. You hear about their hangovers when you check Twitter for the morning news. You see their new apartments when you browse Facebook at work. They can jump into your pants whenever they want by sending text messages that land in your pocket. Online, you watch your exes’ lives unfold parallel to yours—living, shifting digital portraits of roads not taken with partners you did not keep.</blockquote>
