Disclaimer: not my clever title. It's the title of a funny,   funny book by Julia Sweeney that I picked up at the library this week.

In one section, the author is out to dinner with her daughter Mulan when the conversation veers from the life cycle of a frog to the ins and outs (apologies) of  human intercourse. I've been there - it happens just that quick, and it can take you a minute to catch up. She goes on:

<blockquote>**Suddenly Mulan laughed. **

**"What?'' I said.**

**"Oh Mom. You're going to laugh so hard."**

**"Why?'**

**"Because, Mom, you can't believe what I thought you said back at the restaurant. It's so funny. I thought you said that the man puts his penis in a woman's vagina - inside of it - and that's how people make a baby. Isn't that hysterical?"**

**A pause. **

**"That's what I said," I said. **

**"Oh," said Mulan. Her face turned from gaiety to seriousness. There was a long quiet time. Mulan stared out of the window, taking all of this in. **

**Mulan asked "What if people just walked up to each other in the street and started doing it?" Our eyes met in the mirror. Her eyebrows were furrowed and she broke our gaze and stared at some people standing outside Yogurtland. **

**At this point, I decided the best way to approach these questions was to pretend I was Margaret Mead, or some dispassionate anthropologist discussing the mating habit of a particular tribe. "The human species is very private when it comes to sex. They are unusual like that. They like to have sex in private."**

**Mulan asked 'What if you went to a party and there were a bunch of men and women there and they all just started doing it? Would that ever happen?"**

**"No,' I lied. 'That would never happen. Because human beings are so private."**

**'What about cats?" Mulan asked. "How do they do it?"**

**'It's basically the same idea, " I said. "But how do their legs go?" Mulan wondered. "Well, I think the male stands behind the female and...and..they just do, Mulan," I said, exasperated that 'they just do' was the best I could do. **

**"What about dogs?" Mulan asked. "Same thing," I said. "It's basically the same thing for all mammals."**

**But what about their legs?" Mulan asked again. **

**"Look," I said, now desperately tired of this subject, 'I've lost my ability to describe it. Maybe we can look on Wikipedia or something.' **

**So we went to my office and got online. I googled 'cats mating'. And of course there were thousands of videos on YouTube. We watched a couple of them. Mulan was riveted. She  moved her face closer and closer to the monitor. **

**"Now what about dogs?" she said. We watched a few dog videos. She put her hand on my arm. **

**I had another moment out of time. Like when you're in an accident, and time slows to a crawl. I could hear my own breathing as if I was wearing a space suit from 2001. Mulans hand seemed to be reaching out to my arm in slow motion: frame by frame. I believe I remember it this way because it wasn't until then, until this small, intimate gesture,  this gesture of familiarity and safety, that I realised where I'd led us. **

**"Mom, do you think there would be any videos of humans mating on the internet?"**

**I am a monster. An incompetent monster of a mother. **

**I smiled and said firmly "No. There would never be anything like that. Because human beings are so private." **</blockquote>

Ah, so funny. So funny. Me,  I take the approach of answering sex questions as they arise; and stopping the explanations when the questions stop. Six-year-old Peanut has always known where babies come from. I think she first started asking at about age four. Last week, sick in bed, I was watching a French movie on my laptop when Peanut crawled into bed beside me. Pretty quickly (those French!) the pair onscreen  started engaging in some special cuddles.

I dithered, finger over the pause button. "Why is she making those noises?" Peanut said. 'Dunno," I said.

It was a gentle sex scene, nothing weird or scary. I let it run.

"But why have they got no clothes on?" Peanut said.

"Well, that's sex," I said. "That's what sex is."

'Oh, right," she said, and we didn't talk any more about it.

Many people might disagree, but I felt happy about the exchange. I'd much rather Peanut had some clear framework of respectful, non-frightening sex as she grows older and has to deal with some kid showing her porn on his phone at the bus stop. Maybe in another time, when you could protect your children from all sexual images until they were old enough to contextualise and handle them, it would be too young to let her observe the French in their natural habitat.

But the times, they are a-changin.
