# Adding A Little Grit To My Kids

## 6th February 2017

I was listening to the excellent Hidden Brain podcast yesterday as I did the washing up. Keith and the kids were at the beach and I was enjoying the solitude (a treasured and rare pleasure for the stay-at-home mum or ‘lead parent’ as the modern vernacular has it.)

 

This great show called was exploring the notion of ‘grit’ as a marker for success in creativity,   sports and business and looking at applying it to children.

 

What is ‘grit’?

 

We are drawn to the idea of ‘genius’,  so and so said, because it lets us off the hook. This person is incredible at (insert skill here) because they have a magical, innate talent for it. The practice is invivible once we are presented with the finished work: the discarded novel drafts, the many useless theories tested before the mathematical algorith is cracked, the hours following a black line at the bottom of a pool; these things are not visible once we see the novel, the finished theory, the medal-winning 800 metre freestyle.

 

But they have all required many hundreds of hours of what so and so refers to as ‘deliberate practice’ - not really fun, but with an end-point in mind. She calls the magical combination ‘passion plus perseverance’. You must start with a natural love and affinity for the chosen skill, but to that you must add the hard graft in order to reach proficiency, and even, perhaps, ‘genius’.

 

In her family, she encouraged the idea of studying, at all times, ‘one hard thing’, which required some level of deliberate practice. I chatted with my eldest about this last night and she saw how it realted to her piano practice. I said that for me, it related to trying to write a book, and we agreed that we would try to encourage and motivate each other to keep at our deliberate practice.

 

Grit can be learned, like any skill, says so and so. It seems to me like a wonderful attribute to encourage in the kids.
