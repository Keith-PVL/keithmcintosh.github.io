# Team Nigella (Also, Young Barack Is Looking Right At Me Into My Soul, I Think)

## 9th December 2013

Tough year for Nigella Lawson. I love her,   and I'm sad for her. I love her cooking,   her wit, the way she is both bluestocking and sensualist.  I'm so sad for her this week.

She has had a terrible run with the fates - the deaths of her mother, sister and husband from cancer, and now the ugliness of being grilled in court about her drug use and her mothering capabilities by her ex-husband Charlies Saatchi (called, in this <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/julia-baird-nigella-lawson-the-victim-as-charles-saatchi-shows-his-cad-side-20131206-2ywk2.html">excellent opinion piece</a>, a cad, which seems quite the wrong c-word to me.)

Firstly, what's a little dabbling in recreational drugs? This fine looking young man liked to smoke pot and 'maybe a little blow, when I could get it, ' he said. He still went on to be the leader of the free world. Twice.  And he can catch flies in his bare hands. (YouTube.)

Of course, it is impossible to know the truth of any marriage, and ugly to speculate, but  Saatchi's behaviour follows a painfully familiar pattern of the controlling man looking to punish the partner who has left him.

I am going to revisit <a href="http://www.splendidtable.org/bio/nigella-lawson">this podcast</a> of Nigella describing life in Italy, and her difficult relationship with her mother, this week.  She is a fascinating woman, Nigella. I hope she moves on swiftly from this awful period.

Sad now. I might sit here and look at Barack for a while until I cheer up.
