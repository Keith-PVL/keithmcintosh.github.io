# Dreaming Of Life As An Old-School Beach Bum

## 2nd September 2013

 

 

Here we are,   still trapped in the magical mystery bug that disappears and returns moretimes than like Lindsay Lohans career. Tghere's nothinkg like an agngry two-year old with a fever. Like a corporate CEO. 'Make me better!' 'Get me this tathing I want! I think it will make me feel good again! Get it faster, dammit!  No, that is not making me happy like I thought it would! Get me the other thing! I said NOW!'  add something about her weird language that makes no sense. Talking to a disgruntled foreigner who is on drugs.

 

usually lemon juice and bicarb around here. Now, hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant. Any moment: moments from a string of garlic and holy water.
