# modern motherhood and feminism

## 4th February 2014

<h3 itemprop="name">an old peice from the archives - think on this fuirther? <a href="http://mogantosh.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/madness-of-motherhood.html">The Madness of Motherhood?</a></h3>



<div id="post-body-6908910066596474198" itemprop="description articleBody">I've always been a fan of Erica Jong,   ever since I read Fear of Flying as a breathless Catholic teenager.

I love a fiesty dame. Recently she wrote this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704462704575590603553674296.html">New York Times article </a>on modern motherhood,   and her perspective,   as always, made me think. Even when I don't agree with the content of a feminist rant, I will always support a womans right to get shouty. And I understand where these second-wave feminists struggle with the new breed; the bobo, bread-bakey, home-makey, earnest mamas of the current Western zeitgeist. (Guilty as charged.) Jong and her crew fought for women to have choices outside of the home. And here their daughters and grand-daughters are, embracing the kitchen that they emancipated us from.

I thank Jong and her sisterhood for giving me the **choice** to be at home with Ted and Ivy. I don't feel lessened or sidelined by that choice. But the modern world of parenting is a funny beast, and the opinions of strident women like her, and the French writer<a href="http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article7070165.ece">Elizebeth Badinter </a>(whose theory **'give the baby a bottle and have a drink and a smoke too, if you feel like it'**, is sadly missing in the parenting books I've been reading) are important voices.

I think its is time for this examination of modern parenting mores. I worry about the give-me-attachment-or-give-me-death school of thought. Even though I agree with most of its precepts, it always seems to me that Mum comes last in this thinking. Can't you put the damn baby down? Can't you let it cry for ten minutes? Will it really be scarred for life? Really?

Trends in parenting theory will come and go, but what remains consistent is that the whole caper is hard work. Most of the mums I know these days struggle between twin poles of guilt: when I'm house-working, I should be playing with the kids, and when I'm playing, I should be cleaning the house. I am always reading little quotes and thoughts along the lines of **'The dust bunnies will still be there tomorrow. Don't feel guilty about using that precious time to build Lego castles**...' Well, frankly, I don't. I congratulate myslef when I'm building the Lego castles. That's fine mothering, dammit! My guilt comes when I'm sacked out at the end of the day watching Wife Swap (I may have mentioned this before once or twice) and the laundry is piled, unfolded on the lounge.

Attachment, helicopter, free-range or unschooling parents are all still just **people**. Idiosyncratically flawed. That's why all families are different. Me, sometimes I am energetic, affectionate and creative. Sometimes I am buggered, moody and reliant on ABC2. Sometimes Keith is a brilliant mind of his generation. Sometimes he is a grumpy man watching football on the couch in his underpants. I'm not perfect, the kids aren't perfect and our parenting isn't either.

**Do the best you can,** says Jong at the end of her article. **There are no rules.**

Hooray for shouty feminists.
