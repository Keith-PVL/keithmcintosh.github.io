<p <span As is the way with little girls,  there were a few rumblings in the Year 2 friendship circle recently.  I had this brilliant idea that since one of our circle of mums is a child psychologist, it would be a really great and lovely notion to have a session with the girls; gently chaired by this kindly mum, where they played a few 'conflict-resolution' and 'trust' games...work-shopped some strategies on dealing with friendship. Talked it through! Hugged it out! I</span> am hesitant to say that i may even have used the phrase 'so that they are all on the same page'.</p>

<p I sent off the group email, with my usual Labradoodle enthusiasm, and then Keith happened to walk in. Listen to this wonderful idea I just had! I said, and then I watched his face assume the slightly pained look I am sadly familiar with. Gently, he pointed out that it was perhaps important for children to figure these things out in the anarchic tumble of the playground, without the structured 'process' of my nurturing educational  workshop. That in fact the rough justice of the schoolyard was probably important to help knock the edges off.</p>

<p He may or may not have used the phrase 'helicopter parent'. This seemed unfair until I reflected that calling in a professional psychology team at the first sign of perfectly natural emotional growth in a bunch of seven year old's was possibly an overreaction. Oopsy! Chalk that one up to another parenting lesson for me!</p>

<p I thought about it again today, when I read this <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2582334/Mollycoddled-kids-grow-narcissists-Psychologist-warns-growth-play-dates-supervised-adults-creating-generation-children-empathise.html">very interesting piece</a> on the importance of free, unsupervised play. Empathy is born from the developing understanding of life as lived by other people, says Dr Peter Gray, and the growing popularity of 'play dates', where adults are quick to step in and solve problems,  stops children from figuring out how to negotiate and figure things out for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p ‘By definition, free play is an activity that any player is free to quit at any time. Children know that. Their very strong drive to play leads them to behave in ways that reduces the chance that the others will quit, and that means paying attention to the others’ needs and wishes,’ he said.</p>

‘To play with other children you must please them as well as yourself, and that means that you have to get into the others’ heads and figure out what they like and don’t like.

He blames the ‘schoolish’ view of child development – the idea that children gain more from doing what adults tell them to do than from their own self-directed activities - as a key reason for the decline of free play.

‘Even out of school children today are far more likely to be in adult-directed activities and less likely to be playing with other kids on their own than was true in the past,’ he said.

‘As a society we have lost touch with the meaning of childhood.  We no longer think of it as a time of play, but increasingly think of it as a time of résumé building.  That is a huge mistake.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘It depends on the age of the children, but for children aged four and older the parents should, to the degree possible, vanish. Even if they are present with no intention to intervene, they may not be able to avoid intervening.

‘When adults are present, children in our culture look to the adults to solve their problems rather than figure out how to solve them themselves.

‘If an adult can’t literally leave, then she or he should be very busy with adult things – too busy to be interrupted, and should not allow interruption.

‘Trust breeds trustworthiness. Children are far more competent – far more able to take responsibility for themselves and one another – than most of us give them credit for, but they need the freedom to practise that responsibility or else it atrophies.’</blockquote>

In short: butt out, and let the children run their own show, says this advice. It rings true for me. We are so focused on telling our children that they are wonderful, smart, kind, valuable people, on helping them sort out or talk through  their problems, that we run the risk of raising a generation of little emperors - horrible little narcissistic Justin Biebers.

God help us.

If home is the soft place to fall, where my children know they will always be loved and valued , then somewhere else needs to be the place where they learn that their needs are just part of a larger picture. That they are, in fact, not any more important than the next person. Hopefully that way, they grow in kindness and compassion.

The lesson for me is that  I  might have to keep my nose out of their friendships in order for that to happen.
