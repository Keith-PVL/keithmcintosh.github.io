# Honest School Notes #8

## 3rd March 2015

Dear Office, 

I'm happy to say that this post isn't about being late to school,   because we were on time for school today! I mean, you know 'time'...it's relative right? Right? Ha ha!

Well, we would have been there before the bell  if Peanut had not had to run back along the road to get her public speaking notes. That's actually what I'm writing about today.

It's about the speeches and the homework.  The way I help the kids do their homework is to set up our Study School on the big table and then I hover about helping if they ask me, but otherwise leave them to it. (Usually I am too busy to helicopter over them because I am probably leaking salty tears as I play Mums and Dads with my three year old for the fourth straight hour. )

Third-grader Peanuts speech, entitled 'The Making Of Me', was supposed  to be about her values and beliefs. We sat and had a lovely talk about what she thought about the world, I helped her brainstorm some ideas, and then I left her to it. A while later she said she was ready to do her speech for me.

'I was made when my mum and dad had sexual intercourse!' she opened with. 'The sperm met the egg and decided 'should we make a boy or a girl? Should she be beautiful or ugly?'

'That's the joke to start things off, ' she told me in an aside. I nodded mutely. There is very little controlling Peanut's ideas when they get started. She went swiftly into a Communist rant.

'I believe in fairness in business. Like, a banana cost 9 cents, but the manufacturer makes, likes, six cents and the farmer makes, like ...something different, or the shop might...wait. The banana is thirty cents, but they don't...wait. They should all make, like six cents!'

Peanut trailed off and looked back at her notes. 'Fairness in business!'

She moved on.

'I believe in respect. Like respect for yourself means not being all 'you did that so bad, you idiot! And then...' She mimed shooting herself in the head and stuck her tongue out in a dead face.

'You should have respect for people with disabilities and people with religons, ' she said.'Don't be all...' She screwed up her face and  put on a funny voice. 'You've got a religon, ew! That's disgusting!'

She then spent a long time, for no reason, and against my advice, outlining the plot of her novel A Bushwalk Into Books which shamelessly plagiarises, in turn, Harry Potter, The Farwaay Tree, Nims Island and Tintin.

Meanwhile, 6 year old T-Bones homework requires him to use his spelling words in different sentences. So far they have all involved death, zombies or trauma. For example: 'I was in the road and a car hit me I am dead. Ow my leg. I am a zombie now I can walk and talk.'

In short Office, I had very little to do with this homework. Please don't call in the psychologists.I'm pretty sure that this is normal. I mean, what's 'normal' right??

Right? Ha ha!

Right?

Apologies again,

Ms McIntosh
