Like so many of you,   I am incredibly saddened today by the ddeaths ofd Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

I felt very torn about it in recent weeks.

Luckily,   I've not seen the memes and comments on my thread that I know have been circulating - people angry,   baying for blood, supporting the execution.

I never felt that the death penalty was right. But I did feel confused by the outporuing of sympathy I saw for these two men. These two men had willingly organised and partic ipated in an illegal exercise, in a country that clearly warned that the pemalty, if cuaght, was death. The drugs they smuugled had the potential to ruin many people, even to kill. Stories of the boys as younger men painted pictures of them that set off all my red falgs: Andrew was a 'bully' at school. Myan studued mixed martial arts and was said to have an 'explosive' temper.

I couldn't understand the sympathy. I couldn't get on board.

I would never have publicly voiced support for their exeuction - I didn't support it. But I didn;t supprt my many, many friend who voiced their sympathy either. I just stayed out of the debate.

I talked to  my mum, who is so compassionate, and who stood for mercy. I tried to understand her position but I could not get past the fact that they went willingly. That they chose the behveiour that ended in the predicted result.

Today, I am so sad.

I see things differently.

I have been thinking how lost they were clearlysuch lost boys, Andrew and Myan. How they ended up in the drug trade, in part, because of their . In neurological terms, the frontal cortes is not fully develeoped until about age 25. The last of the higher proceses to develop are a sense of maurity in judgement.; insight; a sense of consequences.

The behavor of the two in jail demonstrates a maturity and responsibility that were there, latent, yet to show themesleves at the time of their arrest. Yes, they did huge social damage in their early lives. But in the ten years since, they showed themselves to be capable of good juddhgemtn, opf remorse, and of maturity.

Who among us didn't so stupid stuff at twenty three? Make awful decisions? Just away with stuff by the skin of our teeth?

Had they lived, even with life sentences in jail, Andrew and ff seemed likely to continue to contribute enormously to society, through their redemption story, their rehabilitation and the effort they had both shown to make from their lives something beautiful; something useful. 'Success is cumulative. That no one wakes up successful. It takes hard work behind the scenes where no one else can see. It starts when you set yourself goals, you make sure you do something small everyday.'...he old his cousinDharminie Mani via news.com.au.

Their deaths achieve nothing. Their lives were, over the last ten years, achieving much. How much more could they have offered as mentors, pastors, artists and cautionary tales, had they not been killed yesterday?

Their story is complicated, but compassion is not.It took me some thought to come to it, but I absolutely stand for mercy. I am glad to be Australian today, where the overwhlemking voices of our politiciansd and public speakers confirm that we are not cruel. We beleive in redempotion. We have comassion for the fact that people can make mistakes, and we belive that they can change. We are willing to operate within the grey area. We do not kill people.

With all repsct fgor the sopverienty of Indonesa, and the irrefultable fact that these two boys broke its laws and should be subject to the laws of that country, this death penalty is crule and utterly pointless.

"A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members." ~ Mahatma Ghandi

We don't kill.

Vale, Andrew and mye. May your deaths be a catalyst for change to this brutal system.
