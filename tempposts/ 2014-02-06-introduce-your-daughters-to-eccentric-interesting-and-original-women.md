I love Steve Biddulph,    author of Raising Boys and Raising Girls. <a href="http://www.essentialkids.com.au/older-kids/development-for-older-kids/the-forgotten-years-of-girlhood-20130618-2ofcy.html?fb_action_ids=10152193379719054&amp;fb_action_types=og.recommends">Recently he wrote</a> about ushering girls through that critical age between ten and fourteen; an age that seems to set off all our parenting terror bells.

I don't want to be scared of having teenage daughters. I have two girls of my own,   and I want to help them navigate adolescence with as much lightness and joy as I can. I love Biddulphs take:  'lean in' to your daughters, be close, help them find their passion.

<blockquote>If you can slow down, ease off on commitments, simplify life, and be available for long soulful talks with her when the chance occurs, it will make these years go so much better.

And, since our daughters also have a healthy dose of not wanting to be like us, and just by the dice throw of genetics may be very different to us, they also need to meet eccentric, interesting, different and original kinds of women. Of all ages. Women who do stuff that breaks the boundaries - explore, create, innovate, fight for what they believe in, women of every size shape and kind. That way your daughter can borrow and steal all the great aspects of being a woman that she wants from a wide and wonderful palette. She needs real or surrogate aunties, people who stick around, tell her home truths, talk about topics we would blanche to even mention, but she needs to know about.

Finally, a girl has to find her spark. Spark is the name given by researcher Peter Benson to the fact that in every girl, and boy, there is an interest or passion waiting to burst into full flame. It could be animals, music, art, science, saving the earth, healing, sport or creativity of any kind. Its what makes a young person want to get up in the morning. Your daughter has a spark, somewhere inside her, and its up to you and her to find it and give it wings.

Ten to fourteen is when she becomes the person she was born to be. Then she can withstand the growing up years of boys, school pressures, peer groups and separating away from you, already strong in what she thinks is right and wrong, important and trivial, wise and stupid. Give your daughter more of you from ten to fourteen, and watch the difference that it makes.</blockquote>

Love it. Filing this one away for later.
