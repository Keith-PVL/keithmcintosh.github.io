A friend once described mothering a pre-schooler to me as ‘being with your best friend,   who is drunk all the time’. This is so apt. Two-year olds are up for anything, and they do odd stuff. Pudding, for instance, insists on wearing most outfits back to front. Out and about, she will suddenly shout ‘Backwards walking!’ at which point our movement forwards becomes 50% slower than normal.

She is so much fun. But no matter how even-tempered the child – and Pudding, child number three, is the most easy-going of my crew – this stage of development demands that they begin to assert their independence from the Mothership. Two-year olds will pick their moment to stand their ground in defiance of you, and you never know when that moment will come.

For my Pudding, that stand-off for power comes at bedtime, specifically at the moment we need to switch off her light. There she is, all wrapped up in her sleeping bag, teeth brushed, tummy full of milk. We’ve read Olivia and the bloody Wiggles book and we’ve done the Green Sheep, with all the voices. We’ve said goodnight to the siblings and we’ve made it to the bedroom, where the last step of the ritual is where Pudding switches off her own light before being tucked in to bed.

I hoist her aloft, back aching after a full day of chauffeuring and distributing biscuits and hauling laundry. ‘Now turn off your light,’ I tell Pudding, at which point she hovers her finger over the switch and looks at me with mischief in her eyes.

My heart sinks. Here we are. It’s Wounded Knee. It’s the Eureka Stockade. It’s Ned Kelly’s last stand.  I try cajoling, like a camp counsellor on happy pills. ‘Come on, yes! Let’s make it a good one. Switch it! It’s really fun to switch that button!’ She waves her finger to and fro, enjoying the game. I shift her weight on my hip and go stern. ‘No more games Pudding. It’s bedtime. Switch the light off right now.’

Pudding hovers her finger over the button, drunk on the power. She’s totally in charge here and she knows it. She’s heavy and I can feel my frustrated anger start to rise. Holy cow, I have been available all day for games and food and cuddles. Now it is BEDTIME.

‘Not switching!’ Pudding sings in delight. I am so tempted to reach out and turn off the light myself. ‘There!’ I will say. ‘That’s it! You took too long. Maybe you will be quicker tomorrow!’ But I’ve done that before, and Pudding is enraged by it, so mad that she then screams in her bed, creating an intense new bedtime drama to manage that will negate the whole half hour’s calming routine we have just been through.

No, there’s nothing for it but to wait out Pudding’s blaze of glory, this golden moment where she holds all the cards. I adjust her again on my hip, take a deep breath and say ‘You’re so funny, Pudding. Now show me how you can do that switch.’ ‘It’s a couple more minutes, and I’m crying on the inside, but she does eventually tire of the gag and switch the light off. Only then does she allow the last steps of tucking in and kissing and animal-arranging.

Finally, I’m free to hit that couch, where I can rest up for another busy day ahead with my tiny, drunk best friend.
