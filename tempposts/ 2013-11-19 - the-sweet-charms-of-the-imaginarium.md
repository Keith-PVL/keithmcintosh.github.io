# The Sweet Charms Of The Imaginarium

## 19th Whoops 2013

Little Pudding is,   wt two, deep in fantasy land; where the world is a magical place and everything is a story. Today I'v been talking to Babyfinger.

Ivy and the clip of her at two.

Ted and the period he spent as 'Trixie-Jeff'.

I wish I could bottle this pure, creative sweetness. I'll just capture it here in word-pictures, the best I can do.
