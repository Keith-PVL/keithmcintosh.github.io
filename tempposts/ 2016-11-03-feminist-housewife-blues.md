# Feminist Housewife Blues

## 3rd November 2016

Realising how much I comlain about the housework. Draft this for book as well as for blog.

Getting home from vanuatu and feeling defeated by it all.

So bad,   so crushing,   so overwhelming.

the other part of it is: so wonderful.

ref that resrach that says that overeducated mothers rae the most miserable???

When things are at leat at a manageable level -  the kitchen is clean,   the tabletops cleared, there is not a towering pile of washing glaring accusingly at me - I am able to revel in manageing the home and family. I can plan a menu, teach a child to cook, prepare a dinner without working to meet the next timetable amongst the debris of the last meal waiting to be cleared.

Then, I feel great.

I can sort away blankets and jumpers into winter boxes. I can pair the lost socks. I can water plants or tidy the bookshelves or make a room look actually nice and pleasant and finished. I can light a scented candle listen to the radio and clean out the pantry.

But to get to this stuff, the everyday management of the house is overwhelming.

Quotes from the servants book? I think this is key: that stuff about how everybody needs a seravnt and teh char that would come in to do 'the rough' but now....Youtube vids of mothers and their 'cleaning routines'...everybody is working so hard. Does the 'rough' fall to the mums? Wife drought?

Work on this piece . It's important and could maybe be reworked for publication.

I'm not sure there is an answer, particularly.

I have found myself at a place and in a time of life where my job is menial, mundane household labour. My job is to suck it up. And sill be a feminist.

When I have PMT, my bloody-eyed focus is the house.

I am a nester, so it does matter to me, but I'm also lazy and easily distracted, and have limited energy, with my stupid 'bad back'.

I'm the 'lead parent' tasked with running activities, homework, music practice. I get the kids where they need to be, sign their forms, arrange their social lives, their medical needs, their

Keith's work means that we can all survive. His fathering teaches the kids piano and maths. His influence is massive.

My work is what makes our home pleasant, clean and interesting. My work means that dinner is on the table at six and that dinner is nutritious and yummy (with some notable exceptions over the years).

remeber gratitude.

trying to have a non stressed life, and we do!! Keep that in mind. Its a PMT rage thing. But it not nothing.

 

The thing is, it is all a gmable - my work, ephemeral, fleeting, is a marathon that shows itself piece by piece. I'm there to cook dinner every night. Keith can spend his time with the kids playing piano because i am washing the clohes. This is ok, it makes family lufe woinderful for us. But id the beradwinner stopped nwinning bread - the house of cards collpases. This is the great gamble at the heart oif it all. I trtust my relationship, but life moves in myseterious ways.

We could die tomorrow. then weuld i regeret these ten years? Nopt at all. They have been the happiest of my life.
