# Nerd Genetics And Game Night

## 27th April 2014

This letter is probably written by Australian chess grand-master Cecil Purdy,   and describes playing against Keith's philosopher grandfather Gauius. From the Melbourne Library archives.

 Friends, I’ve come to realise that it is only a matter of time before I am outsmarted, outwitted and out -classed by the card sharks in my house. It appears my husband Keith has been enacting a secret plan to raise the children into high-level game nerds, and recently, he took his education program to a new level of geek genius. Last week he taught seven year old Peanut and five year old T-Bone how to make an Excel spreadsheet of their Monopoly moves so they could understand the game statistically, and strategise accordingly.

I am not even kidding. I've seen the document. It's complicated, and it features colour-coded graphs.  The kids had a great time entering all the data, Keith said. 'Was it...hilarious...?' I asked, confused. I could only understand the whole idea as some sort of absurdist comedy exercise. 'No,' Keith said. 'It was just excellent fun.'

Me, I'm not very good at games. I like to play cards but I spend a shameful amount of time with my mouth open, confusing Spades with Clubs. Quite soon, I will be left behind. But every once in a while, I think I have the game at which I will finally, finally beat Keith. T-Bone got Monopoly last Christmas. Here we go, I thought. A level playing field. A game of chance, with room for only a little strategy to skew the chances in my favour.  Time for my moment in the sun.

‘I'm gonna smash you, ' I crowed, high-fiving the excited children. "Daddy's going down!' I shouted.

Pathetically soon, I realised that I had, once again, badly underestimated just how nerdy my husband was. It was clear that Keith didn't only know the price of every street from memory, but also how much that price altered as you added houses and hotels. Sadly, I asked him what other Monopoly strategy he had.

'Well, you should  take into consideration that Chance and Community Chest can send people to Pall Mall, Trafalgar Square, Old Kent Road and Mayfair,' he said thoughtfully. 'Except that “go back three squares” can put you on Vine Street and a couple of others.’

He was getting more enthusiastic by the minute.

‘Also, there's a one in 6 chance that somebody will roll a seven, which is the highest probability, but you need also to consider that because you can get another turn on a double, that it skews the likelihood of whether somebody will land on you, on certain numbers, on certain spaces.'

It was simultaneously masterful and frightening.

'And then there's the return on investment, and on which occasion it is statistically preferable to build houses, considering that one of the worst returns is when you have to sell houses, which is a much poorer deal than mortgaging. And also...'

I stopped him. I couldn't take it.  But I think there is no stopping the kids. It’s in the blood. When Grandpa plays board games with us, he forms a team with Peanut and T-Bone called ‘The League’, and he has even taught them a ‘war cry’ intended to unsettle opponents. So recently we all played cards. First, the kids shouted at us. Then they thrashed us. Finally, Peanut drew a sweet picture of Keith and I. ‘Here you go, Mummy,’ she said. ‘This is you and Daddy being strucken by lightning.’

It seems some form of competitive nerd genetics is at play. I may be in some trouble here.
