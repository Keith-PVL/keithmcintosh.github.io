# Off to School

## 4th February 2014

It has not always been easy looking after nutty little T-Bone. I found this the other day,   written when he was four. He's bigger now,   throwing his body around like a crazed Irish Wolfhound and peppering me with questions all day.'When did Space begin? Why do people say 'after that...' What is gay marriage?' What if I turned the world into poo poo. How do you count to ten thousand? Do it now, do it!'

<blockquote>I overheard my four-year-old son T-Bone chatting to my mother in the kitchen today. 'Nanna, where did the very first people come from?' Mum dithered a bit. ‘Ooh, that’s a good question, T-Bone. I’m not sure....’ It can be tricky, dealing with grandchildren raised as godless atheists, when you are a good Catholic grandmother.   'Yes, and what is your answer, Nanna?’ he pressed. As I enjoyed the show, he made himself clearer. 'Person is one person, Nanna. People is more than one person, Nanna.'

Preschoolers can be very literal, and very specific. Little T-Bone seems particularly so. In fact, ‘that is not correct’ is his favourite phrase, and he uses it on me often. The scientist is emerging in this boy of mine.  His questions are often wonderful: 'Those little round poos I do, Mama. Are they meatballs?' And sometimes disturbing: ‘Can we invent a tick machine that shoots ticks at baddies and then eats their skin?’

He's also developed a forfeit system to stop me distractedly saying 'okay', which, considering I have three children under seven, is about eleven thousand times a day. T-Bone has detected that ‘okay’ means ‘I am not really listening to you’, and has invented  a forfeit system where, every time I say 'OK' I have to wave my arms in the air and sing 'hey, sexy lady’, to the tune of Gangnam Style.  I went along with this for some time, until T-Bone got upset one day and pointed out that I should have learned by now to stop saying 'OK' , instead of saying it as much as ever and then adding 'hey, sexy lady' on the end.

I am finding it difficult to live up to some of T-Bone’s exacting scientific standards. Yesterday he sat me on his bed, and tried to teach me exactly how to sing the verse from his favourite song 'Boom, Boom! Ain't It Great To Be Crazy?' Every sincere attempt I made, T-Bone found some new reason to shout ‘Naughty Mummy!’

Eventually he banned me from singing and told me I was not allowed to make a noise at all, but just to listen carefully as he played the song through. I zipped my lip and nodded seriously. The song began and T-Bone watched me like a hawk to make sure I wouldn't let a note slip forth.

A line or two in, he got slightly off message.  'Mum, ' he whispered. I raised my eyebrows. 'Can I have a drink?' he said. I pointed to my lips and shook my head. 'Can I have a drink Mum?' he stage-whispered. I boggled my eyes at him and wildly shook my hands. 'BUT CAN I HAVE A DRINK MUM!'' he wailed into my face until I cracked and shouted back 'T-Bone! I can't talk! How can I answer you when I can't talk!' He realized what he had done and turned on me fiercely.   'Mum! That is not correct! That is NOT CORRECT!'

'Oh my god, OK, OK...' I shouted back as I clambered out of his bed and left the room but not before I saw his face and knew I had to add 'Sexy lady!'</blockquote>

 

will miss him?
