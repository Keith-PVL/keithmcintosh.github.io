# Shabby Hotel Room Dreams

## 4th December 2013

Last weekend Keith and I left the kids overnight with Nanna and Pop,   and took off to a wedding down the coast.

It was fantastic.

<p I adored the joie de vivre of the groom's mother,   who danced up a storm and provided me with a golden image to file in my 'when I grow up' catalogue. Life force! It is so attractive. What is a smooth or 'beautiful' face compared to a person inhabiting their space on the planet with energy and enthusiasm and curiosity?</p>

We had a great moment when a dandy-looking guy in a wool waistcoat and artistic hair turned out not to be a graphic designer or barber-barista,  but in fact an astrophysicist turned statistician working at Oxford. His job involved crunching climate change numbers. Keith's ears pricked up, and soon the two were intent in conversation. Me, I was basically dribbling as I listened with my mouth open, trying to make the one word in each five I understood match to the English I knew.

We stayed overnight in a room at the local pub. This room had nothing in it except a bed, a bin in the corner, and a shelf mysteriously bolted to the wall. A bare lightbulb swung over the bed. It was a room you could sleep off a bender in. You could spend a night or two in disgrace when the wife kicked you out. You could, perhaps, go through a lonely, shivering heroin detox in that room. But the sheets were clean, the walls were freshly painted, and the bed, although lumpy, was surprisingly comfortable.

Down the hall, the bathrooms were separated by sex. The male bathroom was, curiously, missing both sink and shower rose, and the the female shower sported a hand-soap dispenser high up on the wall.

I was silent and dubious for a minute, and then: 'If we were backpacking,' Keith said, 'this room would be the biggest score.'

It was true, I realised. It was clean, it locked, there was room to spread out your luggage. There was even a little table in the hall with a kettle and teabags, and a telly bolted up high. In backpacking-land, it was a palace.

When we got back from the wedding, we lay back on our lumpy bed and talked about taking the kids around Europe, staying in rooms like this. We debated the merits of Turkey and Italy and the Middle East. We wondered how old the kids should be to handle it, and how we would do it.

In the morning, we read the papers, with no toddler demanding release from the bars of her cot for 'tea-butter toast'.

I carted my stuff out for a shower and passed a fellow resident in the lounge. He was tall, bald and heavily tattooed and looked in fact like the sort of gentleman that fellow prisoners might refer to 'Mad Dog.' But he was quietly having a cup of tea and watching a television cook make a duck lasagne.

Keith and I had excellent Eggs Benedict in a sweet little cafe,  and enjoyed a conversation  in which we finished full sentences without either of us breaking off to say 'The next person to say 'poo' at this table loses half their dessert.'  We hung out on the dock and read the papers and then we made our way north to take our three little friends home from their weary grandparents.

Huge thanks to Mum and Dad for minding the kids. Huge thanks!

We're back in the swing of normal life again now, but that weekend was a beautiful interlude. It reminded me that this life we are living now with very small children; this chaotic  intensity: it is a passing season. One day, these kids will be so big that we can all bunk into a shabby old room together. Some distant place, some distant time.

Until then, Keith and I will always  have Mad Dog's Palace.
