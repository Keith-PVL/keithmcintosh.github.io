# Chat With An Astronaut

## 6th Whoops 2013

Are you familiar with the former astronaut Commander Chris Hadfield? He became the space-dude of the moment when he filmed himself performing Space Oddity...in space.

He is such a cool cat. I listened to a wonderful chat with him on the <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/segment/11/01/2013/chris-hadfield-s-lessons-from-life-in-orbit.html">Science Friday </a>podcast while hanging one of my thousand recent loads of washing. His tale of managing his first space-walk with a piece of grit in his eye is intense. Eventually,   he is blind in both eyes, and forced to call  NASA with the words 'Houston, we have a problem.'

Great listen.
