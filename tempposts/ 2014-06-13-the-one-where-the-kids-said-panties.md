# The One Where The Kids Said 'Panties'

## 13th June 2014

Here's Jerry Seinfeld on parenting,   via <a href="http://joannagoddard.blogspot.com.au/">Cup Of Jo</a>:

"When we were kids,   our parents didn't give a damn about us. They didn't even know our names! But when I think of the bedtime routine of my kids,   it's like this Royal Coronation Jubilee Centennial of rinsing and plaque and dental appliances and the stuffed-animal semi-circle of emotional support, and I have to read eight different moron books. You know what my bedtime story was when I was a kid? Darkness. That was my bedtime story."

God this made me laugh. The 'stuffed-animal semi-circle of emotional support'. Â I think it feels even more painfully hilarious because I've had three sick kids this week, and I'm the only nurse on duty. Keith is away, the midnight-runs are non-stop, and I am constantly running vaporisers, wielding ashthma puffers, force-feeding fruit and dealing with **obscene** snot situations. Today I left the house for the first time in four days. I accidentally called my local barista 'Nyth' instead of 'Nath' (weird Prue and Trude brain fart) and then I tripped over my own feet on the way out the door.

But the worst moment of all was yesterday when five-year-old T-Bone asked me sweetly 'Mum, can you grab me some panties?'

I whipped my head around like Linda Blair. 'You WHAT?' I said.

'I fink that's what they call underpants in America,' he said. 'So can you get my panties from my room?'

I might have scared him a little by the earnest and urgent tone I took as I assured him that we did not use that word in our house, under any circumstances, ever. I thought we'd have longer before we had to have this conversation, but, wow, they grow up so fast.
