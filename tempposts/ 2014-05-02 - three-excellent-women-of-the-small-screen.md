# Three Excellent Women of The Small Screen

## 2nd May 2014

I've been hanging out watching a bit of TV in this recovery period. I had a bad night watching Game Of Thrones this week (hands over face,   tell me when they stop doing scary stuff with the baby, make it end, please, I'm begging you. ) Yes, I'm a little psychically fragile this week, but I also think I've hit my Game of Thrones limit. Enough already.

Give me some juicy drama, some unexpected comedy and a good leading lady any day. Here are a few I'm loving right now:

**Veep** - Julia Louise Dreyfuss as a foul-mouthed Vice-President and Buster from Arrested Development as her sycophantic body-man? Yes please. This comedy is so, so good.

**Borgen** -  Actress Sidse Babett Knudsen is really compelling as PM in  this political drama about the Danish Parliament. It's funny, smart, underplayed. A Scandi West Wing.  I'm in Season 1 - already, I love it. Love love love.

**Nurse Jackie - **Edie Falco of Soprano's fame plays the title character in this excellent medical drama, and her brilliance carries the whole show.  In this <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/04/09/300983914/edie-falco-on-sobriety-the-sopranos-and-nurse-jackies-self-medication">Fresh Air podcast </a>, she  talks about life as an actor, sobriety and her relationship with the late James Gandolfini.

Sharp writing, intelligent performances, and not a Red Wedding in sight.

Happy watchings.
