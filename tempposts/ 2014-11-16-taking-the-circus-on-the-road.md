# Taking The Circus On The Road

## 16th November 2014

Saturday night right on bedtime,   I was so exhausted. Keith was out and I was trying to keep the vibe calm so I could cajole all three kids into bed when T-Bone suddenly ran inside with a frog in his hand.

'A frog!' he yelled. 'I've got a frog and he's my new pet!'

The girls shot off the coach where I was reading Eloise and threw themselves into the spirit of the thing.

'Little froggie', moaned Pudding, poking at the poor amphibian with her dirty little paws.

'Let's call him Trevor,' said Peanut.

'Where did you find him?' I asked T-Bone. 'In my slime bucket', he answered. I enquired no further.

Before I could regain control, Trevor jumped out of T-Bones hands and ran behind the fridge.

I was in it now.'No!' I said. 'It's hot back there! He'll cook!'

I found a torch and shone it into the dust. There sat poor Trevor, just out of reach. I managed to scoop him out with a long spoon and T-Bone grabbed him.

'Out of the house,' I ordered, but before they could make it, poor befuddled Trevor took a  flying leap onto T-Bones face.

'MY EYE!' T-Bone shrieked, running in circles. He ran around so much that it took me a while to grab him and pluck Trevor off. 'My eye!' he screamed the whole time. 'My eye! My eye!'

Poor Trevor finally got back to his slime bucket, and I did eventually get the children to bed, but it was not the peaceful bedtime I had dreamed of.

We're off this morning to Tasmania for a month and we're almost fully packed. In fact it  feels like Keith and I have been cleaning and packing for seven years. At the dinner table last night, I served up a selection of all the leftovers in the fridge. T-Bone made a wrap with scrambled egg and leftover spaghetti bolognaise, and pronounced it delicious. Peanut mused on her future and decided that she might be a doctor as well as a comedian. 'Why don't you combine the two?' Keith and I suggested. She liked the idea and started imagining how it might work. 'Oh, hello Mr Patient, ' she said, 'Your...heart, is that the problem? Shall I...jump on your head?'

Pudding stopped her running commentary on the adventures of her imaginary friends Cauliflower, Big George and Lucy to get in on the comedy too. 'I dot boobies on my gina!' she shouted.

Tomorrow, we take the circus on the road.

Back in a few days with a report!
