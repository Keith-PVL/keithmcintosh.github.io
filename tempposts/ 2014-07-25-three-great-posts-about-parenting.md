# Three Great Posts About Parenting

## 25th July 2014

What are you up to this weekend? We have a bonfire party and a visit from Grandpa (where he'll probably <span <a href="http://mogantosh.com/nerd-genetics-and-game-night/">get The League together</a></span> and kick some ass in Milles Bournes. The kids beat Keith and I at 500 last weekend. They were not gracious in victory.) Otherwise: rugby,   a big pot of dahl and some delightful; together time combing nits out of the whole family hair. Tonight I'm hoping Keith will watch Another Thing with me,   but he's got a massicve workl deadline next week,   so we might just have to cuddle up together on the lunge, playing footsie and tinkering on our sep[rate devices. Ah, modern romance.

For your plasure, here are a few great posts on parentoing that have struck me this week. Also, I'm heartsick about the family that lost three children inthe MH17 crash. I am looking at my three with opened eyes this weekend, counting my blessings and wishing peace and healing to this poor family.

Happy weekending, my friends.
