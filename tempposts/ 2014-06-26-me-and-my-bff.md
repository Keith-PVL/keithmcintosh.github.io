# Me and My BFF

## 26th June 2014

My seven year old was talking to me about friendship stuff at school yesterday. It's like,   one day you're BFF's!' she said,   'and then,   the next day, nothing!'

Her animated little face was so expressive, so familiar to me. It was like she reached inside my chest and gave my heart a little squeeze.

I pulled off my washing-up gloves and launched in. 'Have you ever heard the phrase 'give somebody the benefit of the doubt' ?'  I said.

At the same moment, we both realised I had employed one of my standard mama-chat phrases, and we both laughed.

I don't know why, but I always do this. Have you ever heard the phrase... I say:

To walk in somebody elses shoes...?

Don't judge a book by its cover...?

Beauty is only skin deep...?

Maybe its my Catholic childhood, imprinted on me - all those parables and moral tales. Maybe it's my very compassionate and kind mother, who always told us 'There but for the grace of God go I.' Maybe Mum talked like this.

Anyway, last night I realised that instinctively, my parenting style is an Aesop major with a minor in interpretove power ballads.  . I love these little conversations, unpicking the way the world works, trying to help my little ones find their way. And i am so hapy they are still so little. Can you kiagine her at sixteen. 'habe you ever heard the phrase...shutup mum i hate you!! wat did you even have me!!!!

'Anyway, me and Daddy will always be your BFF's, ' I told her.  (This is true. Whether she likes it or not!)
