# Kristen Stewarts Poetry Is Hilarious, Terrible

## 12th February 2014

 

Twilight star Kristen Stewart,   famous for her Bitchy Resting Face,   has been writing poetry. It's mean to laugh. I know. But come on. It's bloody hilarious.

**My Heart Is A Wiffle Ball/Freedom Pole**

I reared digital moonlight

You read its clock, scrawled neon across that black

Kismetly … ubiquitously crest fallen

Thrown down to strafe your foothills

…I’ll suck the bones pretty.

Your nature perforated the abrasive organ pumps

Spray painted everything known to man,

Stream rushed through and all out into

Something Whilst the crackling stare down sun snuck

Through our windows boarded up

He hit your flint face and it sparked.

And I bellowed and you parked

We reached Marfa.

One honest day up on this freedom pole

Devils not done digging

He’s speaking in tongues all along the pan handle

And this pining erosion is getting dust in

My eyes

And I’m drunk on your morsels

And so I look down the line

Your every twitch hand drum salute

Salutes mine...
