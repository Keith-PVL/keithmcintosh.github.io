# Sex Tips From The Past: Sexual Positions, From The Historical To The Useful When Multi-Tasking

## 20th August 2014

 

I missed last weeks Sex Fom The Past post. It was such a busy week,   and I was so tired; you know how it goes sometimes.I should have just scheduled it in – but I didn’t get to it. Or probabaly,   if I had have just started it,   I would have gotten into it

And hello again. Magnus died in 1280 AD, but before that he ranked five sexual positions from 'most acceptable' to 'least acceptable' as follows:

1) missionary

2) side-by-side,

3) sitting,

4) standing and

5) a tergo (a classy Latin way of saying 'in the style of the dogs').* *

Magnus said the missionary was the only completely "natural" position; the others were "morally questionable but not mortally sinful. In certain situations, however, (such as extreme obesity), these other positions could be not only acceptable but even practica

The Karma Sutra, ancient erotic Indian text, contains such a total of 64 positions, known as the 64 Arts.

This chapter was pirated from the 1Suggestions from Cosmopolitan include ‘The Linguini’ and ‘The Sensual Spoon.’

Missing, in my opinion, the common positions 'Wait, Did You Hear That Noise?' and The 'Ow, Football Hamstring Injury' and the 'I Really Should Wax my Legs'.

But ahoy,  if it's a busy week for you too, here are some brilliant ways to multi-task getting on the job with, um,  getting on with the job. (Cartoons found <a href="http://www.break.com/article/funny-kama-sutra-cartoon-positions-2611554">here</a>.)
