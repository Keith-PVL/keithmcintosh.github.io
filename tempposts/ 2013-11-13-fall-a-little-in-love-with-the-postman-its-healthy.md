# Fall A Little In Love With The Postman It's Healthy!

## 13th Whoops 2013

I read a wonderful article recently explore the work of realtionship psychologist  Barbara Fredrickson. (If you're not following Brain Pickings on Twitter,   check it out. t's wonderful.) Her notion of 'positivity resonance' stayed with me. This is Frericksons reframing of traditional ideas of 'love'. It requires the combined actions of the brain, the hormone Oxycontin, and the vagus nerve that connects the brain to the body. When these three work in sych, positity resonance happens, and the magic canoccur with any person, any group of people, any stranger.

<blockquote>'Perhaps counterintuitively, love is far more ubiquitous than you ever thought possible for the simple fact that **love is connection**. It’s that poignant stretching of your heart that you feel when you gaze into a newborn’s eyes for the first time or share a farewell hug with a dear friend. It’s even the fondness and sense of shared purpose you might unexpectedly feel with a group of strangers who’ve come together to marvel at a hatching of sea turtles or cheer at a football game. The new take on love that I want to share with you is this: Love blossoms virtually anytime two or more people — even strangers — connect over a shared positive emotion, be it mild or strong.'</blockquote>

The difference between intimate love and the micro-moments of connection with strangers? Time. Time spent, experiences shared, that's all. The essential neurophysiolof=igcal is the same

I love this notion. Sometimes I have those days, when my smile is easy and the gags come quick, and I laugh with shopkkeepers and people in the street. Those 'love is in the air' days.

It's love!

 

amazing way of looking at love in terms of time spent, connection.

 

being seen.

beautiful.
