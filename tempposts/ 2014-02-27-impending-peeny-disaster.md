# Impending Peeny Disaster

## 27th February 2014

Young Peanut was asked to bring a pinata to a Mexican party at Girl Guides next week. I contemplated making one,   then I slapped myself across the face  (Wake up! You crazy fool! )  and bought one from the $2 shop.

Here's the problem - the pinata is shaped like a dalmatian, Peanut's favourite dog. She has taken to calling the pinata 'Peeny' (I really enjoy this), carrying Peeny about and patting her lovingly.

I feel very concerned about next Tuesday when a bunch of rowdy eight year old girls smash Peeny to pieces with a cricket bat.

Chalk it up to another life lesson?
