# Addicted To Stories: 3 Great Storytelling Podcasts

## 28th February 2014

“We are,   as a species,   addicted to story. Even when the body goes to sleep,   the mind stays up all night, telling itself stories.” Jonathan Gottschal

Watching the documentary Mitt recently, I thought how powerful storytelling was. As Mitt interacted with his witty, gentle, improbably good-looking children, I found myself warming to this religious, conservative politician; despite the fact that his values and beliefs are largely the polar opposite of my own. He was funny, and he picked his way through the war-zone of an election campaign with grace.

Storytelling is powerful. I think human stories make us less afraid of  'the other'. They inspire compassion. They celebrate our difference. They make us think. They connect us.

I love story-telling podcasts. They give me the chance to step into the shoes of another and walk around for a while, like Atticus Finch would have us all do. Here are a few of my favorites:

<a href="http://themoth.org/">The Moth</a>

Each episode, a twenty minute story. The Moth has a huge archive of stories that roam all around the landscape of human experience. I have often been moved to tears and laughter by The Moth. A recent sample - here's <a href="http://themoth.org/posts/storytellers/adam-savage">Adam Savage</a> (the beret-sporting Mythbusters engineer) talking about how to help his sons navigate sex in the Internet age. 'You need to understand that the internet hates women', is the take he landed on. It's quite genius.

<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>

One of the original and best storytelling formats, each episode of This American Life is split into three acts around a central theme.  It's almost always a great listen, and actually, it's been particularly great lately. It's having a moment...  <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/517/day-at-the-beach?act=2">This recent story</a> about an adolescent attempt to impress a girl that went terribly wrong had me weeping with laughter over the washing-up.

<a href="http://snapjudgment.org/">Snap Judgement</a>

Funky, funny, Snap Judgement is a newer find for me, but I really like it. Last week, <a href="http://snapjudgment.org/family-secrets">a story from a girl</a> who found out in adolescence that her dad was not schizophrenic but, in fact, a mobster - specifically, the head-godfather of five crime families. Awkward...

What are you up to this weekend? We have an old friend coming to stay. I'm cooking roast chicken and key lime pie;  we'll play cards, and if the rain eases off, we'll go for a bushwalk (but this time, <a href="http://mogantosh.com/comedy-children-will-tell-strangers-you-are-nude/">keep our clothes on</a>.) On the down side, my back keeps going into spasm, and I'm hoping it will stop.

May all your stories from this weekend have happy endings, and just a little comedy nudity.
