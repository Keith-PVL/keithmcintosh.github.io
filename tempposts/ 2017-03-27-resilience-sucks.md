# Resilience Sucks

## 27th March 2017

In theoiry I am a big fan of that notion of letting kids handle tough stuff so that they grow stronger,   learn coping strategies, and generally eqiup themsleves for the harder times in life. But in practice, when a child is struggling it is so hard not to want to do everything possible to end that pain.
