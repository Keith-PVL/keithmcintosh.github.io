# The 'Lovely and Powerful Grief' Of Leaving A Relationship

## 12th April 2015

Not me and the K. We are solid.

But I read a beautiful <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/06/david-whyte-the-journey-house-of-belonging/">review on Brain Pikcings yesterday from poet and philosopher David Whyte.</a>

<blockquote>One of the difficulties of leaving a relationship is not so much,   at the end,   leaving the person themselves — because,   by that time, you’re ready to go; what’s difficult is leaving the dreams that you shared together. And you know that somehow — no matter who you meet in your life in the future, and no matter what species of happiness you would share with them — you will never, ever share those particular dreams again, with that particular tonality and coloration. And so there’s a lovely and powerful form of grief there that is the ultimate of giving away but making space for another form of reimagination.

His poem:

THE JOURNEY

Above the mountains

the geese turn into

the light again

Painting their

black silhouettes

on an open sky.

Sometimes everything

has to be

inscribed across

the heavens

so you can find

the one line

already written

inside you.

Sometimes it takes

a great sky

to find that

first, bright

and indescribable

wedge of freedom

in your own heart.

Sometimes with

the bones of the black

sticks left when the fire

has gone out

someone has written

something new

in the ashes of your life.

You are not leaving.

Even as the light fades quickly now,

you are arriving.
