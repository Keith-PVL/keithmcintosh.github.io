# Games

## 18th February 2014

Keiths invented game of Trumps,   sep by step,   he adds rules of 500; until it will eventually turn into 500.

I remember playing 500 at university; my gormless mouth, full of chips and gravy and cheap beer,hanging open a bit as I tried and failed to keep up with the rules.

We're big on games here. Uno, of course, and Battleship when we can't get out of it; Spit and Cheat and other card games. A French racing game called Milles Bornes from Keith childhood. When Grandpa is here, he and the kids form a team they call The League. They even use his war cry from Armidale High in the 50's.

(Can IO find and post this video) .

Keith and I sometimes play the League as the Axs, and sometimes as The Commmon Enemy. The last time they beat us thoroughly, and then Ivy drew a picture. "Here, Mummy, hereis you and Daddy being struck by lightning.'

Competitive much?

Ted got Monoloply for Christmas

Georgie doing her poo ruse to get out of the bedroom; moves potty closer to th ottoman, bit by bit. So happy when she gets there she cant stop kissing Keith on the cheek. We can't bear to break her heart.

Ted kisses his hand if it's a good one. When he gets the Joker, he hugs it.

I know that I will be the weak link in this gaming tribe. But now, playing against the 5 and 7 year olds, I am not too shabby. I shall enjoy it while it lasts.

I thought I remembered how to play Monopoly, until I played again with Keith.

I'm gonna kick your ass! I crowed. The kids looked excited.

<li>remembered the price of any house on any street and how they changed as you added houses and hotels,</li>

<li>dont put houses on when nobody uis coming near you on the baord</li>

<li>taling into consideration that Cnace and community chesty can only send people to Pall mall, traf square, old kent road and mayfair, excepting that 'go back three sqares' can put you on Vine St and a couple of others.</li>

<li>Therers a one in 6 chance tghat somebody will roll a seven, which is the highest probability, but you need also to consider that because you can get abother turn on a double, that it skews the likelihood of whether somebody will land on you, on certain numbers, on certain spaces.</li>

<li>And then theres the the return o investment, and on which ocassion it is statiscally preferable to build houses, conidering that one of the worst retuns is when you have to sell houses, which is a much poorer deal than mortgaging. .</li>

<li>Theres the times where its preferable to be in jail, and when its worth paying the fiftyt dollars to get out quick.</li>

<li>Theres the scenarios when its advantageous to auction.</li>

Keiths proudestr moment, was with Ivy, when she was winning, and she had four houses on each of the browns, and I was appraching. She's a canny Scot. I sad 'PUt hotels on! Youve got money! Shge correctly told me that was a poor strategic dcision because if I were to land on it I'd out of the game with four houses, she'd clean me out regardless, so there was no point in spending the money o an upgrade.

She won the game.

Keiths Monopoly rules. so happy when he
