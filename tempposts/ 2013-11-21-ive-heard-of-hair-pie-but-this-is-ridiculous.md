# I've Heard Of 'Hair Pie' But This Is Ridiculous

## 21st November 2013

The notion of 'food groups' has pretty well penetrated most of the developed world by now.

It has,   oddly, though, skipped Australia's corridors of power.

Back in --------- two-time leader and slang-happy Kevin Rudd got a little peckish and nibbled on some ear wax while Parliament debated some legislation.

You'd think a memo would have gone around after that, advising politicians not to nibble on themselves near the cameras, now matter how boring the speeches. Â Nope. Our zany decision-makers are at it again! This week, opposition MP..... had a little 'hair pie'.
