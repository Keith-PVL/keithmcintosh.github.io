# Family Band Uopdate

## 6th June 2014

For the files: a collection of Rainbow Connection covers:Â http://www.metafilter.com/77060/Ive-heard-them-calling-my-name

Also,   a list of the best shmaltyzy songs of all time.

 

Something about this story made me so very happy. demon voice woman makes groper shit his panst: jezebel

what other great stuff recently? what about one or two of those great long-form reads from back of pantry door?

This is getting a lot of runs on the boards:

the frozen cover with the dad singing.

We're spending a lot of time around the piano in the family karaoke zone. Out latest number is the Split Enz classic 'I Hope I Never'...such a mournful, beautiful song. I have Laverne and Shirley firmly in my sights though: I feel like we might have to sing this number every day before school.

Laverene and shirlkey vid.
