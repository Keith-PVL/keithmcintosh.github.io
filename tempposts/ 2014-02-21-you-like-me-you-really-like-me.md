# You Like Me! You Really Like Me!

## 21st February 2014

My friends,   I have started a Facebook page for this blog and if you want, you can 'like' it and receive updates as I stumble, tap and arkwardly crump my way through this thing I call 'life'.

And now, I'm logging off to clean the kitchen, hang the washing and make some walnut brownies for the kids coming over later to watch a Friday afternoon movie. I think I'm going to listen to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02m2g5c">this podcast </a>about Russia from the Start The Week archives,  to try and understand a little more background about Putin and what is happening there now.

Have a wonderful weekend.
