My favourite time of the day is 6 o’clock. That’s when Keith appears from his office down the bottom of the garden,   the kids are summoned from their various hidey-holes with my Von Trapp whistle,   and we all sit down for dinner together.

In truth, it doesn't  always go smoothly. Three kids under eight are not the most debonair of dinner guests. Someone is likely to answer 'because poo' to any question, the debate is less than high-minded and children have been known to suddenly vomit onto their vegetables. Frankly a dinner where nobody soils themselves or is sent to the naughty corner (or both)  is a win.

But I love the family dinner table,  and I like romance to triumph over cold hard evidence,  and so I persist. I love planning meals and menus. I love gathering the tribe together over food to process and discuss the day. Sometimes there is candlelight. Sometimes I match the music to the meal (Nana Moscouri is always a hit on souvlaki night, FYI) and sometimes after dinner there are card and games. In the winter we even have a ritual of learning poetry. (Wholesomeness-overload? My apologies.) Family dinner feels very sacred to me. Not every family is able to manage this time together. Shift work and long commutes can make it hard, and I really appreciate this time we carve out to sit around and look each other in the eye.

Every family table is as unique and idiosyncratic as the family itself, I think. How do other people do it, I wondered?  I’ve asked a couple of food and family bloggers that I admire to talk today about their experiences of family dinnertime. Ruth from <a href="http://gourmetgirl-friend.blogspot.com.au/">Gourmet Girlfriend </a>and Mel from <a href="http://coalvalleyview.blogspot.com.au/">Coal Valley View</a> both have five children. If anybody can sling a prawn on the family barbie, it's these two.

Today, Ruth talks about the dinner table at her place, and tomorrow, I'll post Mel's thoughts.

Here's Ruth, hilarious, warm, a lover of colour, and a mum to five boys aged  15, 13, 11, 7 and 5.

**How often do you manage family dinner together, and is that the only meal the family shares?**

As the ages of my children vary so much- so do weeknight bedtimes. This means that there are 2 sittings for dinner- one for the littles and one for the bigs. I sit down at both. On the weekend it is different- we try and eat every meal as a family. I also eat breakfast with the big two (they are both at high school) every day. It is a time I treasure with them. The only part of the day that feels truly uninterrupted with them.

**Could you take us through a typical family dinner at your place?**

I rarely cook the same thing -  it is often a last minute 'what's in the fridge' affair.  There is always music and candles and conversation. The rest is usually a surprise! My big kids are happy to eat whatever I serve so weeknight dinners mean I can cook whatever I like and they will happily eat along with me &amp; my husband. This isn't the case for the littles (but I now have the experience to know they will outgrow it and it doesn't matter) - it is super simple food for them i.e; cheese on toast, dippy eggs, pancakes, simple stir fries, fried rice, homemade chicken nuggets etc.

**I’m working on a plan that each of my kids will start cooking one meal a week for the family from the age of ten. At ten, they get the ‘keys to the kitchen’, at which point they are free to create whatever they like in there. How involved are your kids in the family kitchen?**

What a great plan! I hope it comes to life! I started cooking for our family of seven aged 10 years old too. To many surprised folks out there it really can happen! In our house the involvement of my kids is from the choosing of the ingredients at the Farmers Markets to the final dish. Whilst my kids don't have any scheduled time in the kitchen I am happy for them to be involved at any time. The unplanned sessions are often the most enjoyable. I like to think that as we are all in the kitchen most of the time that they are learning form absorption as well. And to be honest for me the importance for me lies in the time we spend together in the kitchen more than what they cook . I think my kids have an incredible knowledge of food already because of the way it is viewed in our house.

**Do you do dessert?**

No we don't. I have never done dessert &amp; I guess it is partly because we didn't do it as kids either. But I am really not much of a sweet tooth. Although my husband just bought me an icecream maker.....dangerous.

**Do you have dinner rituals: best-and-worst of the day, cards after clean-ups, board games?**

I love this question- mostly for the ideas of yours about what could happen afterwards but to be honest time is such a limited commodity in my house with five boys that whilst I would love to say I do....I don't. I am too busy herding arious humans to bath, bed &amp; story time before Dinner round two!

**Who cleans up?**

My boys do the dishwasher. I clean up after myself as I cook.

**What’s your philosophy or underlying thinking about the family table?**

There are two main things for me that are my driving philosophy.  The first is the importance of cooking real food and being thoughtful about our footprint on our precious earth. Eating ethically is important to me.  I want my children to grow up knowing that it is important to take responsibility for their actions and to feel a sense of responsibility to the broader community. Human beings live in a society as a group and I feel we have a responsibility to take care of each other. To be mindful that our choices about the way we behave in all aspects of our lives have an impact on others- our choices about food is not separate from this.

Just as importantly is seeing the time spent at the Family Table as an investment in the heart &amp; souls of the people you are sharing with.  The food doesn't need to be fancy. It just needs to be served with love. People are what count.

**Finally: a favourite family meal:**

We honestly don't really have a family favourite as I rarely serve the same thing twice........ but  the ingredients that are in EVERY family meal are : Love, Laughter, Music &amp; Togetherness. It always tastes delicious.

I'll be over at six Ruth. Sounds like a great party! Thanks for sharing your table with us. You can read more from Ruth and access your archive of delicious recipes at her blog <a href="http://gourmetgirl-friend.blogspot.com.au/">here</a>.

Tomorrow, Mel from Coal Valley View talking about her family dinner table. If you would like to share with the hive mind, leave your thoughts on food and family in the comments box.

Bon appetit!
