Ever since T-Bone <a href="http://mogantosh.com/taking-the-circus-on-the-road/">found a frog at bedtime and named him Trevor</a>,   the kids have had a thing for tadpoles. There's a big overflow container next to our rainwater tanks, and they have spent many happy hours fishing in it, collecting 'Trevors' in jars, and keeping a Trevor Health and Progress Chart (one memorable entry: 'Looks like he's looking for something'.)

But six year old T-Bone has developed a more specific interest in the small, disgusting container he calls his 'slime bucket.' I cannot paint a more vivid portrait than that - it is a bucket, and it is full of slime.

The dark, gritty liquid that lives in the bucket would be more than slimy enough for most people, but not my T-Pot. He's on a mission to make his bucket full of the slimiest slime ever known to man. He has poured soap and milk in it, to feed the Trevors. He has added lettuce seeds to it, and he wees in it often (because that works on the lemon tree). T-Bone is sure that his slime bucket is going to grow the best lettuces ever.

I caught him yesterday with his hand in the slime bucket and I decided that enough was enough. 'I'm tipping the slime bucket over the deck,' Â I said, hoisting the disgusting concoction up high. 'It's a health hazard.'

'Nooooooooooooooooooooo!' cried T-Bone, as through I was proposing to throw away his first-born child. 'Please Mummy! Not my sliiiiiiime buckeeetttt!" Real, anguished tears were shed.

I had to relent. I suppose I had not realised how very important his slime bucket was to him. I set some new guidelines: you can add stuff to it, you can stir it with a stick, and you can wee in it if that is so critical to your experiment, but you cannot touch it, ever.

I only hope that he has not, in fact, hit on some crazily accurate scientific frog-Frankenstein formula (soap plus small-boy-wee plus slime) and at some point, massive Trevors will start emerging from the bucket and hop onto my pillow in the middle of the night.
