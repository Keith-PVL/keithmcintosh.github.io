# Marriage, Courtesy

## 8th January 2014

**Let us be guests in one another's house

With deferential "no" and courteous "yes";

Let us take care to hide our foolish moods

Behind a certain show of cheerfulness.**

Let us avoid all sullen silences;

We should find fresh and sprightly things to say;

I must be fearful lest you find me dull, 

And you must dread to bore me anyway.

Let us knock gently at each other's heart,

Glad of a chance to look within–and yet,

Let us remember that to force one's way

Is the unpardoned breach of etiquette.

So, shall I be host–you, the hostess,

Until all need for entertainment ends;

We shall be lovers when the last door shuts

But what is better still–we shall be friends.
