# Love, Illness, Injury

## 11th February 2014

Day 1,   week 2 of the first school term of 2014 and my back went out. Not too badly,   just enough to send me the message **slow down,   you're moving too fast**. Painful. But OK.

I've been throwing myself into too many new year projects at once, and the poor asthmatic boy child has need constant attention, including trips to school every few hours to make sure he has his puffer.  After a super busy day yesterday of houseworking, running errands and wrangling the energetic toddler,  my back started spasming at the dinner table,  bending me forward like a snail. I scuttled off to bed, and Keith took over the final shift of the night. He's a good egg (head.)

It was timely to read <a href="http://bobisdysautonomia.blogspot.com.au/2014/02/saturday-night.html">this beautiful piece</a> on illness and marriage.

<blockquote>Another Saturday night done and dusted. A moment of greatness. In an unremarkable house. On an unremarkable street.Love isn't grand gestures. It's not choreographed flash mobs. Diamonds, or dozens of roses.

It's quiet moments on Saturday nights in the tiny coffee-coloured ensuites, of everyday brick houses. It's a steady, gentle presence in the midst of pain and illness. It's the hand that holds another's when they sleep. Transferring strength and comfort in equal measures.</blockquote>

The author, who is hilarious, suffers from a bastard illness  called Dysautonomia (made famous when Greg the Yellow Wiggle was diagnosed) and she  ended up in hospital not long after writing this post. She's doing OK. I send her love and best wishes. Me, I'm taking it easier today. Hope you're all keeping well out there. x
