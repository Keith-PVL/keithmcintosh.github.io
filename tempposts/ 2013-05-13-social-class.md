I pondered on this a little ;e today as I sorted the obscene pile of laundry on my bed and listened to the BBC4 podcast Thinking Allowed. It was an episode about the new social trend for the middle class to gather in massive gated communities. One they described in China housed 50,   000 people. Another,   built along the coast,   featured hidden speakers behind the palm trees which played birdsong to enhance the atmosphere.

In the course of life, one sociologist said, people may move up and down social classes. Last week we sent Keith's old caravan office to the scrap yard. He's working now in a beautiful, tranquil little office space that we had built out the back, on the site of the old cow shed. In the caravan, he was used to spiders dropping on his head, and possums fighting in the roof
