# Five Great Posts About Parenting

## 25th July 2014

<img class="photo-horiz" src="/images/2014/07/Hair.jpg" />

<a href="http://www.retronaut.com/2013/11/children-hairdresser/">1932,   Children at the hairdresser. </a>'I can see one wriggling Enid! Get the fine-toothed comb and make it snappy!'

Yes, OK, so we've all got head lice but the toddler has taken to telling me 'I love you Mama' a hundred times a day, instituting the policy of the 'hug-wee' and calling me  'fart-bastard'. So in balance, life's all pretty good.

What are you up to this weekend? We have a bonfire party lined up, as well as a visit from Grandpa (where he'll probably <span <a href="http://mogantosh.com/nerd-genetics-and-game-night/">get The League together</a>. </span>The kids beat Keith and I at 500 last weekend. They were not gracious in victory.) Otherwise: small-boy rugby, large-man soccer, a big pot of dahl and some quality together time combing nits out of the  whole family's hair.

Tonight I'm hoping Keith will watch Enough Said with me, but he's got a massive work deadline next week, so we might just have to cuddle up together on the couch, playing footsie and tinkering on our separate devices. Ah, modern romance.

I've been heartsick this week for the Maslin family, who lost lost three children, as well as the children's grandfather,  <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/maslin-family-releases-tribute-to-children-killed-in-mh17-disaster-20140723-zw69z.html">in the MH17 crash</a>. I am so moved by their courage and grace in the face of unimaginable heartbreak.

<blockquote>"No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for our children, for Mo, for Evie, for Otis. No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for Grandad Nick. No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for each other. This is a revelation that gives us some comfort."</blockquote>

Here are a few posts on parenting that have struck me this week:

Beautiful insight from Lisa at Waltzing With Matilda on <span <a href="http://waltzingmatildamummy.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/on-nurturing-and-parenting-sensitive.html">parenting a sensitive child</a>.</span>

Hilarious shenanigans ensue when Steven at The Uneducated Opinion<a href="http://www.theuneducatedopinion.com/adventure-dad/"><span  takes his toddler out</span></a> for the day. 'I don’t deal well with high stress situations and I rate playgrounds with a courageous two year old more stressful than telling your wife you got another woman pregnant.'

It's funny because i's true: Angie from The Little Mumma lost her shiznit over <span <a href="http://thelittlemumma.typepad.com/the-little-mumma/2014/07/not-winning-at-motherhoodor-am-i.html">parenting in the wintertime.</a>

</span>

Finally, I loved this post: <a href="http://momastery.com/blog/2013/06/21/quit-pointing-your-avocado-at-me/"><span Quit Pointing Your Avocado At Me</span></a>, found via Stacey at <a href="http://theveggiemama.com/">The Veggie Mama</a>, and as part of the Parenting Around The World series at A Cup of Jo, this post about <a href="http://joannagoddard.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/20-surprising-things-about-parenting-in.html">bringing up kids in Germany </a>is fascinating. ( One cultural quirk that struck me: it's not really cool to teach kids to 'share'. Rather, it's preferable to encourage them to 'stand up for themselves.' Very interesting - but German readers, is this true?)

Happy weekending my friends.
