# One Woman Is Ashamed One Doctor Has Funny Ideas And One Dictionary Needs a Little Scrub Down

## 18th October 2013

I have to make an appointment for a pap smear. It's overdue and I'm dragging my heels. I have such terrible memories of the last one. Here,   from the archives, the shame of my last appointment:

<blockquote>a)  When your (young, male) doctor puts a big book up on the examination table, covers it with a paper sheet and says 'I like to do the procedure like this. It gives a better picture of your cervix,' it is OK to find the situation confusing and request clarification.

You are wrong to assume that the Pap smear protocol has changed, and the doctor wishes to sit in front of you on a stool.  While the doctor washes his hands behind the curtain, you should not take off your undies and then awkwardly straddle the book while trying to maintain a blase expression and keep up your end of a conversation about Lord Howe Island. He did not mean you to mount the book. He meant you to lie down on the bed and then rest your hips up high.

b) Do not allow your three year old son to play with your phone while this humiliating exercise unfolds. He will take photos. And video.

c) Change doctors.</blockquote>

The memory still makes my toes curl. Nonetheless I must gird my loins (never so appropriate a phrase!), book an appointment with a nice lady doctor ('with small hands' as Tim Mathieson might advise) and get the job done. I'm trying to get organised and crack through my life-admin.  Lots on the to-do list. This weekend, we are celebrating the 7th birthday of our eldest with a Dracula cake, fish and chips and a family Survivor-viewing session.

Chop chop! Must get on! And now I have left you with an image of me smiling fixedly, straddling a giant dictionary and naked from the waist down,  my job here on the internet is done.  Farewell my friends! Happy weekend!
