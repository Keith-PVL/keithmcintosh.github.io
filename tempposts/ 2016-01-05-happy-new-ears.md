# Happy New Ears

## 5th January 2016

 

When the fiddle had stopped singing Laura called out softly “What are the days of auld lang syne,   Pa?”

“They are the days of a long time ago, Laura,’ Pa said. “Go to sleep now.”

But Laura lay awake a little while, listening to Pa’s fiddle softly playing and to the lonely sound of the wind in the Big Woods. She looked at Pa sitting on the bench by the hearth, the firelight gleaming on his brown hair and beard and glistening on the honey-brown fiddle. She looked at Ma, gently rocking and knitting.

She thought to herself “This is now.”

She was glad that the cozy home, and Pa and Ma, and the firelight and the music, were now. They could not be forgotten, she thought, because now is now. It can never be a long time ago.

Little House in The Big Woods, Laura Ingalls Wilder.

For me this year:

Making stuff

Cooking vegetables

Learning French

Feeling fit and strong

Writing my book

 

For you, I hope, much laughter, love in your life.
