In the Big Room of our little house,   we have a big squashy couch that was bought as a wedding present. It was bought with the dream of holding lots of kids,   before they had all finished arriving. I think they have all finished arriving now.

The couch is long,   L-shaped, puffy enough to lose an infant in, grey enough to hide a multitude of mysterious stains. It hosts towering plies of washing, buries old bits of toast, and serves as an acrobatic base, a reading nest and a wrestling ring. It's been vomited and pissed on. It's been shat upon by birds (now there's a  story) and it harboured a mouse we called Hunca Munca for a while.

This week, it held all five of us for most of a long Tuesday as we recovered from a tummy bug. I read Goosebumps out loud to Peanut while holding T-Bones clammy little hand. Keith slept, bucket close by, recovering from an awful night, while the kids played a Uno tournament on my belly.

I was the least sick of the bunch, but still had a dose of the shaky, achey, queasy horrors,  so I was on Matron duty, fetching and carrying for the three sick little ones. I need my nummy. My beepy. A cuddle. My gogo. My puppy. My book. The spew bowl!

Eating-on-the-lounge rules were suspended for the duration as the little patients picked at bowls of grated apples and Sao biscuits. We got quite invested in a reality show called The Next Great Baker. I slept for a while while Keith read The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. He slept for a while under a little pile of pink-cheeked, overheated daughters.

I left the couch when I could to run an endless cycle of washing through the machine, but the baby, attached like a limpet, needed the comfort of my heartbeat and my warm breath. Overheated and floppy, she was twice as heavy as usual. The kitchen accumulated debris, the world went by outside the window, but for Tuesday, our universe shrank to that squashy grey couch.

It's a good couch.
