# Last Minute Fathers Day Present!

## 3rd September 2014

Kon-Tiki.

Quote that wonderful quote at the beginning.

Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdal took a wooden raft across the Pacific in 1947,   just to prove that it could be done. On board he had five freinds,   all cool Scandinavian dudes of different types.

 

Exapmaple quote fo that great redhead..

This book is funny, smart and an absolute classic of the adventure genre. Heyerdahl and his gang are the original and the best beardie-weirdies.
