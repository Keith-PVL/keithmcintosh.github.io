My son T-Bone just turned five. Yesterday, he followed me through the house with a piece of paper as I was gathering washing, distracted. I was probably muttering to myself like a madwoman, and I wasn’t listening very hard to T-Bone.  ‘Look at this, Mum!’ he shouted. ‘It’s a peep-machine! A peep-machine!’ I winced a little. His volume is permanently on eleven these days.

‘Inside voice, *please*, T-Bone,’ I said pointlessly.

‘But look at my peeper, Mama!’ he begged. I put my washing down and took the paper. He’d cut holes all over it. It was clearly one of the inventions he’s taken to making lately. ‘Shakers’ made of boxes glued together are having a moment, and frozen ‘killers’ made of leaves and blueberries have been popular too. I held his paper creation to my face and made a guess. ‘Hello!’ I called through the holes.

‘Noooo!’ T-Bone wailed, enraged. ‘No Mum! *That is not right*!’ I knew I’d got the peeping wrong, but I still wasn’t expecting my mellow, easy-going son to pick up a soccer ball and throw it at my head, before falling to the floor in a weeping fit.  No prizes for guessing that I am having a bit of trouble managing my boy at the minute. He’s up, he’s down. He’s crying, he’s laughing.  He’s happy, he’s mad. It feels a bit like I am living in some sort of Real Housewives Pre-schoolers Special.

The extreme naughtiness of the soccer ball incident aside, his behaviour is pretty standard stuff for his age. Why walk when you can run? Why talk when you can shout? And why give a sensible answer to a question when you can bring yourself to tears of laughter by simply answering ‘put a poo on your head?’ It’s all normal developmental stuff, they say, but it’s hard work to manage and my eyes have leaked salty water a few times lately with the frustration of it all.

It takes a lot of energy to meet the demands of parenting this little dynamo with patience and calm and acceptance. I fail often. Sometimes T-Bone goes to bed in disgrace, denied dessert, perhaps even given the final undignified punishment ‘No honey on your Weet-Bix tomorrow!’, but he still migrates into our bed in the night, sleeping his twitchy adventure dreams; feet in my stomach, his fluffy hair tickling my nose. We’re in this roller-coaster together.

Meanwhile, I’ll keep counting to three like a demented mathematician, keep trying to capture those gangly arms and legs in a hug whenever I can slow him down long enough, and keep trying to remind myself that T-Bone may be hard to parent right now, but it’s hard to be a little boy too.

Sandwiched between the can-do-everything six year-old and the get-away-with-everything two year-old; he’s not the baby, not the big boy. He feels more than he can handle, and he wants to do more than he can manage. T-Bone drives me nuts and then he tells me ‘Look, Mum! I found a way you can give yourself a kiss on the lips.’ He blows a kiss and steps into it. He is delighted with himself. And I am besotted with my boy again.
