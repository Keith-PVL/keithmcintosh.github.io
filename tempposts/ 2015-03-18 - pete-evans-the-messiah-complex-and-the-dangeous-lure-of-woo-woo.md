Celebrity chef  turned nutrition guru Pete Evans has been under the spotlight again this week. The last time he got this much attention was when he outlined his complex Paleo daily diet in Daily Life Magazines 'My Day On A Plate' feature. I was on Evans' side that day. Who gives a crap whether he gets up at 4am to activate his almonds? He's a big boy. He's allowed to have a hobby.

But power corrupts, as they say in the classics, and over the last year or two Evan's Paleo star has been on a meteoric rise. With large numbers of (fiercely engaged) Instagram and Facebook followers as well as an empire of Paleo cookbooks, TV shows and speaking tours, he has hit upon a cash cow.

The Paleo diet eschews processed food, dairy, grains and sugar for fresh vegetables, fermented goods, meat and 'superfoods' (pretentiousness is optional.)  Now, there is some good eating to be had with this diet, despite the fact that the committed Paleo-phile is required to spend hours in the kitchen fermenting, preparing and  activating their food. Also, its costs a lot of money to eat this way. ( Products don't **have** to be hand-rolled on the hips of fair-trade Peruvian pansexuals , but it helps.)

Lately, the activated-almond jokes have been replaced by more serious questions. As his influence grows, health professionals have increasingly questioned Evan's claims that the Paleo diet can shrink tumours, cure autism, stop asthma and reverse chronic fatigue, amongst other things. The Facebook group Blocked By Pete is populated with nearly 5000 users, many health professionals who claim that comments challenging his nutrition stance have been deleted from Evans' Facebook page.

This is unsurprising. Pete's Instagram and Facebook pages are bursting with enthusiastic followers claiming medical breakthroughs, cures and miracles that have resulted from their Paleo lifestyle.  They are defensive of their community and leap quickly to deride and discredit any objection. Evans himself calls his critics 'the non-empowering media'.

Last week, publisher Pan MacMillan decided not to release the cookbook 'Bubba Yum Yum; The Paleo Way For Mums, Babies and Toddlers' (where the Dads are, I cannot tell you)  which Evans co-wrote with blogger  Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin.

Le controversy!

The Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA),  expressed fears about the DIY baby milk formula recipe contained in the book, a liver and bone broth containing Vitamin A levels found to be 749 percent higher than in commercial formula.  Also, the broth was found to be 2,326 per cent higher in vitamin B12, 1,067 per cent higher in iron, 879 per cent higher in sodium and 220 per cent higher in protein, all of which can lead to adverse outcomes.

Dr Joanna McMillan (via <a href="http://www.theglow.com.au/">The Glow</a> website) says

<blockquote>The concern...with this ‘Paleo formula’ is the quantity of liver and the frequency it would be fed to the baby. Consider that half a cooked chicken liver (about 10g) contains almost double the upper limit recommended for vitamin A for an infant aged 6-12 months. Lamb liver is even higher with the same quantity providing 4.5 times what is considered the safe upper limit. You can see that while a small quantity of liver once or twice a week as part of a mixed meal might be a wonderful nutrient boost, drinking a liver-rich broth daily could be extremely dangerous. Amongst other problems, chronic vitamin A toxicity can cause bone abnormalities.</blockquote>

Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the Public Health Association of Australia, was blunt. “In my view, there’s a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,” she told the Australian Womens' Weekly. (Incidentally, the book is being investigated by the Federal Health Department.)

After Pan MacMillan decided not to publish,  Pete Evans remained silent on the topic for days, and then announced that he would be 'thrilled' to publish the book on a digital platform. In his words:

<blockquote>Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that "Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way” will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow. We didn’t want to wait, too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove of nutritional recipes and we are extremely thankful to all our followers and colleagues for their support. A huge thank you also goes out to all the media for them helping to raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same. Keep up the great work promoting paleo. Xo</blockquote>

'We didn't want to wait'.

'Too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove.'

Look out Pete!  Your hubris is showing.

I'm floored by this.  Respected Australian health bodies have expressed concern that infants could die as a result of his advice -  professionals that don't have the skin in the game that Evans does, with his fast-growing, profitable empire. But Evans does not - or cannot - respond to their concerns. If  Evans can defend his position, he has a responsibility to do so.

Still, this non- response itself fits Evans Paleo 'brand', which positions itself as edgy and unconventional, in opposition to the mainstream of nutritionists, dietitians and traditional health bodies. In Evans' happy, glowing Paleo-Land,  'haters are gonna hate', and true believers have to rise above the  fray to fight for what they know to be true, in their (nutrient-dense) hearts.

Cultural obsession with diet is nothing new. You know that old saying 'every generation thinks they discovered sex and coffee'? Well, it apples to food fads too.  The Israeli Army diet, macrobiotics, veganism, raw-foodism, fruitarianism, Pritikin, juice-cleansing...the list is endless, even just from the last century. Paleo is the latest in the line, but the Paleo Way has landed in something of a perfect storm of anti-scientific sentiment and social media culture than gives its moment in the sun a dangerous edge.

Let me go back a step.

I've got no problem with the Paleo Way per se. Clearly, focusing your diet on natural and unprocessed foods is far superior to the modern packaged-convenience food culture.  Michael Pollan put it best with 'Eat less. Mostly plants.'

I'm a cook. I get it. I like the Everyday Paleo cookbook my mum has - there are some gorgeous recipes in it. I believe, like many people I know, in buying organic where I can, fair-trade, sustainable,  free-range, fresh and pasture-fed.  I think there is a lot of scientific sense in the growing body of knowledge on gut health, a suspicion of GMO, and a rethinking of traditional approaches to nutrition.

But the danger lies in the absolute evangelical passion of the 'food as medicine' bandwagon, and where it intersects with the 'bio-hacking' and 'wellness' movements. Dig into Paleoland a little and you meet a near-impenetrable wall of psuedoscientific jargon. It is almost impossible to discern the fine line where the descriptions of anatomy, physiology and psycho-pharmaceuticals veer from authentic science into nonsense.

Any human should have the right to live their best life, as they see it. It is where these desires intersect with social media, and the value we give to information gained there, where the terrain becomes murky. Like Evans, bio-hacker Dave Asprey of Bulletproof Coffee (with a shot of butter) fame, has a huge social media following, and an incredibly engaged audience who regard him as something of a guru. (Incidentally, Asprey, like Evans, is not above testing his theories on newborns. He describes sprinkling 'probiotic powder' on his wife's nipple immediately after birth so that their infant could have a supercharged first breastfeed.)

Listening to Asprey talk is like trying to understand Esperanto. Where is the line between bullshit and reality? Like Evans, he is charismatic. Like Evans, he is business-minded. Like Evans, he co-opts the language of science, while discounting the very core of its evidence-based foundations. And like Evans, he is making a shit-ton of money.

Charismatic leadership and compelling shared stories were at the heart of the 'wellness' movements of Jess Ainscough and Belle Gibson. Both of these bloggers amassed huge social media followings (and in Gibson's case, a highly lucrative 'wellness' app and cookbook) by parlaying the story of their own fights against cancer into profitable business platforms. Both advocated the (largely discredited) Gerson diet, which replaces conventional cancer treatment with vegetable juices and daily coffee enemas. Sadly, Ainscough, known widely as the 'wellness warrior',  died this year, as did her mother, who also followed this diet. Many doctors have stated that both their lives could have been prolonged with the conventional treatment they refused.

Gibson's case is slightly different. Although she is yet to comment publicly, her platform The Whole Pantry is in free-fall after allegations surfaced that funds were misused, and that her claims of cancer in her 'brain, liver, spleen and uterus' (which she blamed on the HPV vaccine Gardasil) were likely bogus.

These women were a source of hope and advice to many suffering with cancer. It is hard, in fact, to imagine how many lives were shortened as a result of following Ainscough's (sadly misguided) and Gibson's (at this stage, it appears,  utterly fictitious accounts of) treatment.  The fresh-faced youthful beauty of these two wellness bloggers was critical to their success, adding gorgeous visual punch to their anti-scientific, dangerous brand. They are the poster children for the Age of Woo-Woo.

As with climate change (where media persists in stating the outlying, hugely discredited stance of denial as 'the alternative position') and childhood vaccination (where rates are plummeting due to the misinformation available online) these wellness platforms offer a lifestyle that places itself outside the mainstream. Why be part of the staid, untrustworthy, 'government-owned', conventional, Big-Business, so-last-century medical maintream? Why not join the hip, fresh-from-the-surf, natural, energetic and fashionable counterculture? Why not try....**the Paleo Way**?

In the end, people will do what they will, and they can follow a guru if they choose, but we  have a shared responsibility to care for  the vulnerable in our communities. In the cases of Ainscough and Gibson, ill and desperate people with cancer were exploited and harmed. With Pete Evans Paleo cookbook, infants are placed in danger.

Like in the Age Of Enlightenment, we humans rail against the cold rationality, the unpalatable ambiguity of science. We want fast answers. We want stories. We want pretty visuals and digestible soundbites. Like Mulder in the X Files, we 'want to believe'. Unfortunately,  evidence-based, peer reviewed science is not infallible. But like democracy, it's the best system we've got.

This current place we've arrived at, where great swathes of 'consumers' throw off science and medicine in favour of what feels right, looks good and sells well, is a frightening place to me. And the rulers of these new landscapes, the gurus of these new paradigms, don't seem to be using their power carefully.

Activate your almonds Pete,by all means. But don't activate your Messiah complex while you're at it.
