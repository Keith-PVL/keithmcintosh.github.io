<p March 1943. Rochester,   New York. "<a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/14792">The Babcocks at the dinner table</a>."</p>

Yesterday, Ruth from Gourmet Girlfriend took us through the<a href="http://mogantosh.com/hive-mind-the-family-dinner-table/"> family dinner routines</a> at her house. Today, the lovely Mel from Coal Valley View opens the curtain on her idyllic Tasmanian homestead and lets us nosy-parker around a little. Mel has five kids, aged nine, seven, five-year-old twins and a seventeen month old baby. She's a tiny bit busy.

**How often do you have dinner together?**

We generally have dinner together every night, usually as soon as Daniel walks in the door, somewhere between 6 and 6.30. It's something that's really important to us. We lived in Sydney a couple of years ago and the commuting and long work hours just didn't make this possible. We really missed not being able to eat together as a family. We eat breakfast together on weekends, however weekday breakfasts usually involve the kids helping themselves and eating around the table while one of us makes their lunches for school (and the other finds their socks!).

**What’s a typical family dinner at your place?**

Dinners are a pretty slapdash affair at the moment. The kids are still young and I'm usually pretty tired by the end of the day so the focus has been on simple, healthy food with as minimal preparation time as possible. I just throw things together, nothing fancy. They are all fantastic eaters. We used to entertain a lot and I do love cooking but with the kids the ages they are, especially with a baby, my priorities are elsewhere. I'm looking forward to devoting more time to spicing things up (pardon the pun) in the kitchen down the track. I cook from scratch but I've never menu-planned and rarely consult cookbooks. I tend to recycle the old faithfuls - Spaghetti Bolognase, Risotto, Lasagne, Stir Fry, Curry and Sunday Roasts. Daniel loves cooking so he takes over the cooking role on weekends and dinners are a lot more exciting.

**I’m working on a plan that each of my kids will start cooking one meal a week for the family from the age of ten. At ten, they get the ‘keys to the kitchen’, at which point they are free to create whatever they like in there. How involved are your kids in the family kitchen?**

This is my dream too - all 5 kids cooking a meal a night! Our 9 year old is excellent in the kitchen and already does a lot of cooking. She'll bake cakes in the afternoons without any assistance at all and on weekends she'll prepare and cook the pancakes. The boys enjoy helping me prepare food because they are always in the kitchen and always hungry! They love being in the vegetable garden and picking things out themselves to eat for dinner too.

**Do you do dessert?**

Not every single night during the week but as much as possible, even if its just a bowl of ice-cream. Weekends always involve the baking of cakes and yummy desserts (because that's when Daniel is in charge of things :-)).

**Do you have dinner rituals: best-and-worst of the day, cards after clean-ups, board games? **

Not really. We tend to let the conversation flow organically but we make sure everyone gets a chance to talk without everyone talking over the top of each other. Our biggest challenge is getting them to sit sill long enough to eat their meals.

**Who cleans up?**

The kids help clear the table and whoever doesn't cook is usually in charge of cleaning up.

**What’s your philosophy or underlying thinking about the family table?**

I think it's a wonderful way to connect as a family. There are no distractions at the family table, just the seven of us enjoying each other's company.

**Finally: a favourite family meal?**

The Kids would probably say lasagne.

I'd probably say lasagne too. Thanks Mel! You can read more about Mel's life in the beautiful Tasmanian Coal Valley, and be transported by her beautiful photographs <a href="http://coalvalleyview.blogspot.com.au/">here. </a> Please visit and wish her the best, she's had a bit of a tough week.
