<p It's been a week since I've written here. My fingers are itching to figure things out a little,   my brain is having trouble engaging gear,   and  I'm feeling...out of sorts.</p>

<p Le New Year!</p>

<p We bailed on a party up the road and spent the night watching Harry Potter with the kids and eating chips. Bed before eleven. K quietly got pissed while I held a hot washcloth to my blocked and painful sinuses.</p>

<p I've been spending a sorry hour or two with middle -of-the-night insomnia lately. I think lying down aggravates my stupid face. Yesterday,   my back started playing up too, so when I woke up for last night's midnight party with myself, the miserable silence was oppressive.</p>

<p I headed out to the lounge room to watch TV and Keith, my solid comrade,  traipsed out behind me. On the couch, we experienced the joys of early morning free-to-air. TMZ was horrifying: celebrity-baiting by lecherous pumpkin-tanned creeps. The best show featured a religious couple, heavy on the Pan-Stik; the minister earnestly speaking for his wife, who nodded like a dashboard ornament.  They introduced an Australian preacher, who just could not pull off the theatre of American evangelism with her 'chicks for Jesus' kind of folksy Outback shtick. It was comedy.</p>

<p Keith and I lay on the lounge. He draped a beach towel from the laundry pile over his cold feet while I necked back a Sudafed and Nurofen cocktail.</p>

<p 'You're my best friend,' I said to Keith.</p>

<p 'I'm your only friend,' he said.</p>

<p Ha ha! It's not true, of course. Ha ha! How we laughed!</p>

<p But then...</p>

<p This is what happens when I feel like crap: I isolate. I become very protective of my limited energy and I retreat to solitude wherever I can carve it out. I've felt, over the the last six months, often unwell, often overwhelmed. Life with small children is unavoidably busy. There is work, there is housework, and always, relentless forward motion. The next thing,the next thing.</p>

<p I have been bad at keeping up with my friends. Text here, email there. Facebook 'like'. Quick Instagram comment. Social media is in fact a great boon for these times - getting out and out about feels a bridge too far. I need to retreat and conserve the juice in the tank, and at least online, I can feel connected in part to what's going on outside my little nest.</p>

<p It' s a good nest. It's happy. It's where my healthy children sleep, and my supportive parents live nearby. We have food and shelter and luxuries like takeaway coffee and osteopathy and iTunes. I have so many heartwarming moments with the kids and Keith, every day. I cherish this life.</p>

<p But I am struggling to stay positive right now. Which...you know, it's this low-level constant sickness; I think, beating me down a little. Just just reading back over all this self- indulgent moaning makes me cringe a little/lot. Why am I  recounting this stuff? Shut up!  Stoppit! What kind of strange little diary am I curating here? For what? For **who**?</p>

I'm not sure of the answer to that,  but I do know this: What is the point of this space if not to be honest? What is it otherwise? Bad fiction? A fourth-rate magazine? The witterings of a nobody into the wind?

I don't know where this little blog will travel this year. I know that I have some really interesting interviews for you. I have roped in wiser minds than mine to tackle some of the everyday domestic issues that interest me. I have plans, and at least three and a half ideas on a Post-It note somewhere. You can think of me as a farty old Labrador, if you like, offering you up a dead mouse every once in a while. The mouse might stink, and fine okay, the dog does too, but you know, in the right light, she has a charming smile. And her furry back is nice to put your feet on.

Mostly, I am going to aim for truth. And a little bit of funny.

But not today, it seems.

Happy New Year, all of you who have visited here. Thanks for your supportive comments, your advice and your company.
