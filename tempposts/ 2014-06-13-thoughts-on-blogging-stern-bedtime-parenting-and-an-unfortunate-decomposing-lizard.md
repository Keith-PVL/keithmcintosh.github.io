# Thoughts On Blogging, Stern Bedtime Parenting and An Unfortunate Decomposing Lizard

## 13th June 2014

One of the lovely parts about blogging for years is having a record of things which otherwise fly past in that early-childhood blur of nappies and mashed pumpkin and sleep psychosis. Newer readers might not know that I used to write at <a href="http://www.mogantosh.blogspot.com.au/">a different blog </a>(still live,   but shutting down any day now.) I decided to start a new blog as the kids got older and I felt more conflicted about how much I shared of their images and stories.

So now I write here. This sort of odd little space. It's not really a mummy-blog anymore; except when it is. It's a sort of everything-and-anything blog; a bubbling casserole of my wanderings through domestic life and modern culture. It is what I am - a work in progress. A curious idiot. Writing here keeps my creative brain ticking over. I love it.  When I write here,   I am primed to write other things too. How long will I keep this funny online notebook?  I don't really know. I don't really know who's reading anymore. I know from my stats that you are reading, but I'm not sure why, or who you are. I'm glad that you are here though.

Kellie from <a href="http://dear-olive.blogspot.com.au/">Dear Olive</a> reminded me of this post from my old blog. Here, I think the kids are aged about  five and three. It still makes me laugh to be reminded of young Peanut; who at seven is still so beautifully expressive, and little T-Bone, who still cracks me up (and still takes enormous delight in messing with his sisters vibe.) I've changed the names to the pseudonyms I use now for the kids, but otherwise it's reproduced below as I wrote it then.

<blockquote>Peanut has been upping the ante on bedtime shenanigans lately. The last three nights she has found reason after reason to emerge from her room and beg for time off her sleeping sentence. There's been a lot of 'I'm hot', some 'I'm hungry' and one heartfelt 'you need to understand, I'm just not up for it.'



Two nights she has pulled 'My eardrum hurts.' Now, Peanut is a seasoned theatrical actress. It's not her first time around the boards. She's been honing her craft since her early pre-verbal head-banging performances. By age five, she has developed a subtle style. Both Keith and I have fallen for the sickness at dinner-time ploy (and once memorably, refused to be fooled. 'Nope!' I insisted one night. 'Your tummy does not hurt! You will sit there until you finish your vegetables!' Sit there she did. Until she vomited with the beginnings of a gastro bug.)



 

You cannot sneakily pass a quick hand over Peanut's forehead to check for fever. She clocks it. And she knows, then, that she has found a chink in your armour. I went along with possible-ear-infection for a while but I knew Peanut was acting when she forgot which ear was hurting. 'Wasn't it the other ear before?' I asked as she held a cold washer to her face. 'It's....moving!' she said quickly. 'I think it's moving around.'

 



T-Bone had been quietly watching this medical drama unfold. 'My regg!' he suddenly wailed. 'My regg is hurting!' Peanut looked at him with horror and then back at me. 'That's not real!' she shouted. 'It's not even real!' Ah yes, I thought. The day has come for the student to betray the teacher.

 



'My regg!' T-Bone moaned, waving both legs in the air.

 



'That's it from both of you,' I said. 'No more banana work. Go to sleep.'

 



Last night, Peanut didn't go near the ears. Instead, she complained about the smell in her room. I went in to check. 'Oh, it's fine', I told her. But it did actually stink. 'Go to sleep.'

 



I went out to ask Keith if he'd noticed a smell in the kids room.

 



'What does it smell like?' he asked. I thought about it. 'Sort of like a cross between Dencorub and shit,' I said. 'Well, I did put Dencorub on Peanut's foot earlier...' he said. 'So it's just shit then,' we agreed. And we laughed. Like the evil parents we are.

 



The crying continued. 'It really stinks!' Peanut sobbed. ' I can't sleep in this smell!' Both Keith and I went in and turned the light on. We inspected the room but there was no obvious stains. We questioned T-Bone but he denied poo crime.

 



'I think it's my foot,' she whimpered. Keith smelt her feet. 'Well, Peanut,' he said - always the meticulous scientist - 'you seem to have a small amount of foot odour but that's not the big stink.' I laughed. I couldn't help it. Poor Peanut was infuriated. Eventually she went off to sleep. This morning Keith found a rotting lizard in a bucket outside her bedroom window.

Life, it delights me. It's ridiculous.
