# Trees Adventure Park: A Review (Contains Middle-Aged Humiliation)

## 11th November 2014

<p align="center">Disclosure: The family visited Trees Adventure as guests of the Park,   but all opinions are my own.</p>

Last weekend,   I questioned my life choices. I was standing on a timber platform five metres above the ground,   wearing a safety harness and contemplating the swaying obstacle course before me. It was being buffeted by a considerable wind, and I had no way out but the way through,  as they say.

Bug-eyed, swearing like a French sailor and apologising in whimpers to the kindly teenagers behind me, I staggered my way across the wobbly poles, the woven basket and the evil mid-air skateboard.

I was an outlier. All around me, children and adults were having a marvellous time at the Trees Adventure Park in Nowra, where ziplines and obstacle courses thread through the trees beside the Shoalhaven River. It’s like a real-life Survivor challenge, minus the bikinis and thebackstabbing.

My eight year old Girl Guide, my plucky six year old son and my outdoorsy husband were in their element. They scrambled and climbed and sailed through the air with the greatest of ease and pronounced it the best fun they had ever had.

Me, I remembered how much I loved Survivor. Watching it, that is. On the couch with a cup of tea and a blankie on my knees. And I had never felt so much like a middle-aged lunatic as I did that day as I made my awkward, halting way through the course, muttering to myself and wailing like an atonal cat.<img class="photo-horiz" src="/images/2014/11/DSC02560-e1415341041285-768x1024.jpg" />

<h6  That's me. On the cliff.</h6>

 

For the kids, it was the most thrilling physical challenge. Roped up to safety harnesses (the entire course, designed in Germany, meets stringent European safety standards), they can’t actually fall. But they climb to decent heights, clip caribiners on and off, and launch themselves out into space. I love the idea of the children testing their physical limits and feeling that sense of mastery over their bodies. By the end of our session, they were exhausted.

Keith did the ‘black run’, which involved some good climbing up the cliff that borders the course. It was tough, and he loved it, the crazy bastard. I only wish I had that kind of physical strength and agility.

Nowra Trees Adventure is set inside the grounds of the Shoalhaven Zoo. Although tickets are not linked to zoo-admission, you walk through the zoo to get to the park, and the central harnessing and prep area is ringed by the water buffalo, camel and alpaca enclosure. Their calm observation (no judgement here, lady) just adds another layer of charm to the bucolic setting.Staff were kind and careful, taking us through the practice procedures of hooking on and off. There are four levels of difficulty that adjust according to height and age.

It was a step outside normal life for all of us. My creaky spine means I am careful, thinking before I lift and bend, and moving through the world with a certain second-guessing of my body. So I was really out of my comfort zone up on that platform, facing that rope bridge. I may have even got something in my eye when I finally set foot on terra firma again.

My friend Jen always knows the right thing to say.  ‘Don’t worry, Rach, ‘she said.’ ‘When I was there, a massive bikie guy covered in tatts froze on the middle of a zipline and they had to get him down with a sort of crane.’

I felt a little less ashamed after that. And in fact, I’m really glad I did it. Even the juicy bruise I ended up with feels like a little badge of glory. I *earned* that haematoma, dammit! Swinging through trees like an aging mama orangutan!  The kids and Keith are dying to go back, as soon as our youngest turns four and can have a go, but next time, I think I might pack a beautiful picnic and watch from the ground with the alpacas.

Best family day out, though. It’s a thumbs up from me. A big, shaky, weepy, middle-aged thumbs up.
