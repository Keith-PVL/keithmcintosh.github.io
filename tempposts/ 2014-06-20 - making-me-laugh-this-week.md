Passionate Italians made me laugh.

Mostly I am laughing because KEITH is HOME and I am happy. <a href="http://mogantosh.com/cooking-with-kids-greek-yoghurt-pannacota-with-raspberry-sauce/">Pannacotta </a>and <a href="http://mogantosh.com/one-chicken-two-lovely-dinners-roast-chicken-with-lemon/">roast chicken</a> for dinner tonight,   Borgen season 2, a busy couple of days together ahead, and my big water bottle back in bed next to me at night. Yay!

Have a lovely weekend you. Yes you, with the weird rash.

That's an order.
