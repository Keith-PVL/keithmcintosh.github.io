# The Lifetime Wee (Or: The Myth of The Mummy Wars)

One of my kids invented the idea of the 'Lifetime Wee' once. They decided that there was a set amount of wee each person did in a lifetime,   and every time you went to the toilet,   you just let out a little bit of it,   or a lot, as the case may be.

'That was a good old chunk of my Lifetime Wee,' I like to report sometimes as I return from a visit to the smallest room. 'Oh yeah!'

I love the Lifetime Wee and I have thought about it a couple of time lately. I've been thinking about the Lifetime Conversation, or the talks you have with people you have known for decades. There is nothing like the perspective you can get from friends who have seen you in all your incarnations. They have watched you evolve and change, struggle and triumph, wear appalling things (hello, hooded catsuit) and have  shameful meltdowns. They have held your hair as you  threw up into nightclub toilets and composed their faces so as not to reveal their pity as you make excuses for terrible boyfriends. They have been crap to you and you have been crap to them, and it doesn't matter.

(The past is a different country. They do things differently there.)

Over decades of coffee and ciggies and drinks and babies and cake and conversation and tears and laughter, old friends compile an incredible dossier about you. This folder holds scandalous and incrimination information about your flaws, your annoying idiosyncrasies and the negative patterns you are doomed  to repeat, over and over, amen.

But with age comes maturity and wisdom, and part of that wisdom is knowing what to do with that shit-bomb of information you hold on your friends, and they hold on you. The Lifetime Conversation will loop around and around these things, over and over, and if you are lucky, and have kind and wise old friends, they never pull a Snowden and  release the tumbling avalanche of data that could upset and shame the protective fictions you hold on to.

I've got a good number of lifelong friends like these, and the older I get, the more I appreciate them. Good  friends use their powers for good. They talk you through your worries and your problems, reminding you of your capabilities and your strengths. They are gentle with your bullshit. They shine a light on everything that is good and worthy about you, and they help you to gain, over time, the incredible blessing of aging: context. From context comes wisdom, I hope.

That idea that women are pitted against one another in a battle for moral supremacy - this is not something that I experience in my life at all. I have stay at home mum friends, part-time and full-time working mum friends, and any conversation I have with any of them revolves around the same idea: that some parts of each are great, and some a sacrifice, and nobody gets off easy. Also, we talk about hair. I don't know who these women are, these angry ones supposedly roaming around spitting bile about mothers making different choices. They are not any women I know. Do they even exist?

Last weekend, away in the Blue Mountains for a night with friends I have known for almost thirty years (and a sister I've known for even longer!), there was the same approving reaction to the new-season Country Road outfits to the Target outfits  ('Full-price!' was pointed out, and 'Fancy!' replied. ) Different kids schools, different socio-economic situations and different family structures were all represented, but this was all irrelevant. Kids, relationships, aging, work issues and illness all transcend the trappings, and in my experiences, women discard their differences easily for common ground of conversation.

At midnight, we found ourselves in Coles, a couple of wine bottles in, picking up some food for one friend who was unwell back at the hotel. We had a little dance party and laughed like idiots, and behaved like we always had. It wasn't until the next day that we realised that the young checkout girl must have thought we were nuts - a handful of women in their forties wandering about late at night snorting,  taking pictures of each other pulling dance moves and trying on supermarket clothes, then buying a yoghurt, a banana and a bunch of flowers.

She must have thought we were nuts.

Outrageous,  middle-aged nuts.

We might all wear reading glasses now, but inside, we're still all fourteen. May we always be so lucky as to have dance parties in the supermarket and the rich blessing of Lifetime Conversations.
