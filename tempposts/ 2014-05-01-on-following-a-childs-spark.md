# On Following A Child's Spark

I loved <a href="http://www.parentfurther.com/your-childs-spark">this article</a> on following a child's 'spark' . It asked questions like these:

**What is the activity you have to make them stop doing to get them to eat or go to sleep?**

**What activity are they doing when they seem most engaged and alive?**

**When they get to choose what to do on a free afternoon,   what activity do they choose?**

Who knows what kind of future awaits our kids? A land of  high-waisted pants,   a la Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing and Joaquin Phoenix in Her, perhaps? (A woman can dream.) A desolate, post-apocalyptic wasteland? Finally, perhaps,  will we get our flying cars and our housework robots? It's  impossible to predict what the world will look like for our kids.  Sometimes I think we should let go of the notion that the stuff we 'do' can really prepare them.

I  love the idea of just  watching for the 'sparks of interest' that inspire and motivate a kid, and being something of a force behind catching and harnessing them.

My seven-year-old is a born actress and writer; expressive and emotional, a lover of words.  Soon I'll find her a drama class and in the meantime, we will write and read and play-act together. Five year-old T-Bone is mostly obsessed with a game called Plants Vs Zombies, and so I'm thinking...botany? Forensics?  Also, he loves to draw batteries and machines, and so I've taught him how to use a ruler to draw straight lines. Small Pudding has been playing buses lately. All the time with the buses. So next week I shall... take her on a bus.

Mother of the year, you say? Well thank you!

Small things, yes. But following the spark, rather than driving the train - I like it as a driving philosophy for parenthood. It reminds me of Einsteins famous advice to his son: **“That is the way to learn the most, when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you don’t notice that the time passes.”**
