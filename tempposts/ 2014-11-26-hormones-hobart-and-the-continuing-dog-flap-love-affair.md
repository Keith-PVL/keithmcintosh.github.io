# Hormones, Hobart and The Continuing Dog-Flap Love Affair

## 26th November 2014

Overheard today:

T-Bone: Come on,   let's play poos and wees.

Peanut - Oh my god,    that's the worst game ever.

Pudding - Please don't be afraid.

T-Bone lost half his dessert for pulling down his pants in the fancy grocer and shouting'Look at ma penis! Look at ma balls!' His sisters thought this was champagne comedy but I yanked up his pants and hissed,   without thinking,  'What are you, a **savage**?' It seems that all this Tasmanian history is making me come over all Colonial.

Also, the three of them have taken to chanting 'Chicken and boobies! Chicken and boobies!' in the backseat and although it makes them laugh until the tears come, I just don't get it.

They are  still having a blast playing with the dog flap.

As for me, I confess I am hormonal in Hobart.

Yesterday was not  a happy day.

I racked up $300 in parking fines before figuring out that the random yellow lines on the road that seem to appear with no particular purpose mean 'No Standing.' The DVD player broke,  the washing machine broke,  the TV signal died, my phone died and I'm not even kidding, the clasp of my bra broke in the supermarket parking lot.

I felt the sticky soporific slow-moving blood of the pre-menstrual female human in my veins. Tired, grumpy, achy. I think the evil powers of PMT worked on the energy around me and sent everything batshit crazy.

Today, I went to visit Mel from Coal Valley View who lives on a farm just outside Hobart. It was such great fun to sit and discuss the strange world of blogging with another blogger. It's hard to describe to a civilian. Mel made a pavlova for morning tea and then took us down to her strawberry patch where the kids and I picked boxes and boxes of the most massive, delicious berries.

Along with the strawberries, I stole this pic of the strawberry field from Mel's blog:

How beautiful...

As for me, I think the fresh air and farm life cured me a little. Also, complaining is so restorative to the system.

Chicken and boobies!
