# Bookshelf: adventurous women

## 25th September 2013

3 sick kids (Slapped Cheek virus,   a name with a certain medieval charm. It has only mild symptoms,   but the red,   lacy rash makes for irritable children who need to be kept out of the sun.

Wednesdays are my writing day. The complex system of play-dates and daycare floated away like a  fart in the wind. Intstead, I'm writing now as the kids battle for control over a train set at my feet and communicate in screeches of varying volume (and by varying I mean from 'high' to 'earsplitting'). Foccacia is rising in the corner of the kitchen, and we've got nowhere else we have to be. I'll write and email in pockets of calm today.

It's all good.

It does feel like a good day to write this post about  adventurous women in literature. I'll tap it out in snatched moments of calm between 'Insert-name-here hit me! (from the big child, 'I'm hungry', from the middle and 'I dot poo-bum' from the smallest.) Maybe I'l try and keep it real-time.

Punarn! Awarn! My room arwan!

I'm a word nerd, you might have guessed by now. I've got a few favourite literary tropes and themes (moved to Tuscany to renovate a crumbling chateau and fell in love, walked the cmino de santiage,  I love, but one of my favourites is I'm more of a 'I lied about being the outdoor type' types.

I had the  Wild' by Cheryl Strayed:

 

Jessica Warson????

Strayed on losing her mother young:

<blockquote>“I didn't get to grow up and pull away from her and bitch about her with my friends and confront her about the things I'd wished she'd done differently and then get older and understand that she had done the best she could and realize that what she had done was pretty damn good and take her fully back into my arms again. Her death had obliterated that. It had obliterated me. It had cut me short at the very heigh of my youthful arrogance. It had forced me to instantly grow up and forgive her every motherly fault at the same time that it kept me forever a child, my life both ended and begun in that premature place where we'd left off. She was my mother, but I was motherless. I was trapped by her, but utterly alone. She would always be the empty bowl that no one could full. I'd have to fill it myself again and again and again.” Strayed on life:

And here:

“The best thing you can possibly do with your life is to tackle the motherfucking shit out of it.</blockquote>

Love With a Chance of Drowing by Torre DeRoche: Sailing the pacific with a green-eyes Argentinian. For me, second best only to lying in the sun reading the paper with a green-eyed Scotsman.

Escapism at its best.
