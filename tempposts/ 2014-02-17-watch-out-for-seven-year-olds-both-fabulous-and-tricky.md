# Watch Out For Seven Year Olds (Both Fabulous and Tricky)

## 17th February 2014

I saw Peanut's friend O at the school pick-up today,   but I couldn't find Peanut for a while.

'She's going to play a trick on you, ' O said. 'But not today, maybe tomorrow.' Â I was interested. 'What sort of trick?' I asked.

'I think she's going to throw a pie in your face,' O said gravely.

Right.

I'll be on my guard then.
