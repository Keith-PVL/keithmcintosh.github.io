# Comedy By Children

## 13th August 2014

**Life with two (now three!) year old**

****At the diner table,   I told a funny story about  Peanut as a baby. Little Pudding roared with laughter,   and then stopped when we all turned to look at her. 'Wait',   she said. 'Was I there?'  The whole family cracked up then, and Pudding was so pleased at her comedic genius that she tried to keep the spotlight shining by shouting 'Penis!' at the top of her voice.

**Life with five-year old**

'Mum, Do you have gigantism?' T-Bone asked me, out of nowhere last week. 'No, I don't, ' I replied.  But the next day he asked 'Mum, do you have elephantitis?' he asked the next day. 'No!' I told him. He didn't ask me the obvious next question: 'Mum, do you have a self-esteem problem?'  Also, last last week at rugby,  T-Bone swore one of the dads was called 'Arkward' until we finally unpicked the situation enough to realise that he'd heard someone point to him in a group and say 'Well, this is awkward'. He's also said that he's really looking forward to playing in the Under Nines, because the tackling starts then, and so it's like you get lots of cuddles in the game.

The comedic gene is strong in this one, but we are entering a new phase, where we share a glance and understand together a  joke that has gone over the heads of the small ones. I love the funny things that the little ones say -  They are priceless and hilarious. But the shared jokes with my big girl  - not the accidental, charming delights of teh little ones - they are perhaps my favourite.
