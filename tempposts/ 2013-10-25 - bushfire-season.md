# Bushfire Season

## 25th October 2013

<blockquote>I know time is a chameleon; friend one minute,   foe the next. And to take it for granted is one of life's common errors. I know death is a great teacher. It takes away but it introduces much. And you begin to see life in High Definition when the filter of naivete is removed.

I feel a great deal more now and since. I am quicker to tears and quicker to laughter. I am abler. I am hungrier. I am more cognisant. I am more empathetic. I am less scared.I have been to the lowest point and I still somehow managed to look up. And there were faces of people I loved and some I barely knew who were tearfully smiling back at me. And none of this I would have known if not for what happened. Yes, I would have preferred being drunk on happiness rather than being intoxicated by grief.

But it didn't happen like that. I was given these vivid and intense experiences instead, no matter how difficult and how ephemeral.  I have not been overlooked by love, nor been undervalued by loss. I have been alive and I have felt an abundance of everything as a result. That is its privilege and its price.</blockquote>

Mary Coustas, from her 2013 memoir All I Know.

I read this beautiful passage today, and I thought a little about the times when normal programming goes awry. The overwhelming might of nature, the sudden terrible directions life can take, the unpredictable hand of fate that gives to one and takes away from another.

I have been thinking of those who lost lives, loved ones and houses in the NSW bushfires this week. The bushfire season has begun ominously early here in Australia, and we there will no doubt be more fires in store this summer. <a href="http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/file_system/attachments/Attachment_BushFireSurvivalPlan.pdf">Bushfire Survival Plan</a> tips here.

At times like these I am reminded of that notion said to help explain disaster scenes to frightened children: 'look for the helpers'. Volunteer fire fighters have been everywhere this week, including my old friend Amy, who worked long hours, exhausted and hungry  in a physically difficult and frightening job.

<p I am so proud of Amy, and grateful to all these men and women. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
