# A Walking, Eating Tour Of Hobart Town With Gourmania

## 10th December 2014

<p **Disclosure: I attended this walking tour as a guest of Gourmania,   but all opinions are my own. **</p>

<p If you are a food-lover,   as I am, and a mother, as I am, and currently on an extended stay with the family in Tasmania, as I am, then you will understand the joy I felt in my heart when I trotted off recently to join a child-free food safari of downtown Hobart.</p>

<p Freeeeeeee!</p>

<p This is Mary McNeill.</p>

Good face, yes? Mary -  former pastrychef, native Tasmanian -  is the owner of Gourmania, a walking/eating tour company that takes small groups around Hobart. Mary is full of tales that bring the locavore, artisanal Tasmanian food scene to life. She knows all the producers and retailers by name, and listening in as she chats to the butcher or the winemaker is like being ringside for some sort of 'in-conversation' event about food: seriously fun, if you like that sort of thing.

Armed with bottles of Cape Grim water (from the cleanest source on the planet, Mary tell us) our small group in sensible shoes starts the tour at Tassal Salmon, where we taste three incarnations of Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon. (The farming of this salmon in freshwater tanks is the industry that saved the Huon Valley  economy when the apple industry collapsed. Thanks for all the fish, indeed.)

The salmon: gorgeous. And the shop, a wonderland of fishy accoutrements that we had no time to explore. The tour was on the move up the road to the Wursthaus Kitchen.

This shop, packed to the gills with meats and cheeses (and featuring an in-house butcher) is a charcurterie-lovers dream (and vegans nightmare.)

We try the most amazing Australian wagyu beef from Robbin Island  (up near Cape Grim of the 'clean water' fame). The cattle are grass fed on sand dune vegetation between two pristine white-sand islands on the far northwest coast. The beef: marbled and meltingly delicious. We didn't try the wallaby - an 'acquired taste', Mary says carefully.

We taste some cheese, including a raclette that recently won Best Cheese in Australia. Shamefully, I cannot read the name of it. This may have been the point where I start dribbling on my notes?

Next stop, Jackman and Ross Bakery, who win my heart forever with their automatic double-shot policy and their flaky pastry,  then onto Takagi Sushi, where the sushi is lovely and fresh, but my stomach contents are starting perhaps to fight a little with each other. It's time to undo my top button. I make the mistake of winking at one of my fellow food-tourists as I do it,  and she looks at me askance. Read that one wrong. Note to self, etc.

Not to worry: walk it off: both the awkwardness, and the pastry/sushi combo! Past funky Criterion Street and into Cool Wine, where it's time to taste a selection of Tasmanian wines. Mary is impressive again at the wine shop. 'Stewed pear, is it?' she muses with the owner. 'I'm almost getting a  sweet candy at the end.' I nod in agreement. 'Very...drinkable!'  I offer.  I enjoy myself sniffing and inspecting the glass like a proper grown-up. The wines are good, and so are the tales of eccentric winemakers.

Revived, we head up to  Spice World, a Hobart institution where we sniff some lovely evocative boxes and eat a good cinnamon scroll - not too sweet; perfect.

It's hard to keep up with Mary at times. There is a real sense of energy around the Hobart food scene - restaurants and specialty stores opening and thriving.  'Best poached eggs in Hobart!' Mary throws off as we pass Betsey. 'Fabulous whiskey, ' she advises as we pass the Lark Distillery. I'm trying to remember where we are, to take notes, but I'm full of wine and butter, the sun is shining, and I just let it all wash over me.  I couldn't be much happier.

Time for a bite at the Brunswick St Hotel, which started life as a sly grog shop in 1832, but was a rundown old lady until its renovation by three Melbourne boys some years ago.The renovation -  all 30's lead-lights and convict brickwork -  is gorgeous. We taste a Pirates Bay calamari and chorizo dish; served with more great stories about the provenance of the food.

Next, we're treated to a cheese (and honey) tasting session at the Bruny Island Cheese shop which occupies a sweet corner of the historic sandstone Salamanca Arts Centre. (No Matthew Evans sighting, but they do stock his Fat Pig ham.)

Last stop: Smolt in Salamanca Square  for Earl Grey ice cream and  a final story from Mary: this restaurant and bakery is where the French Antarctic Mission stock up on their Ciabatta bread every year. To finish, an exquisite pair of hand-made chocolates from the Cats Tongue chocolatier in Huonville.

It's the end of our four-hour tour and I'm full; both of  good food and of  interesting tales about the Tasmanian artisanal food industry. This tour has given me a real insight into the passionate attachment that Tasmanian makers and growers have to their way of life. It'snot only fascinating, it's inspiring, and it's wonderful to observe in this way.

If you love a bit of history with your food, and own a pair of sensible shoes, then a Gourmania tour is a fantastic way to spend a morning in Hobart. More details <a href="http://gourmaniafoodtours.com.au/">here</a>.

PS -  It's been a very food-centric few weeks for me in Tasmania. Deliciously so. One more review to come: the Agrarian Kitchen School, and that's it for the sponsored Tasmania posts. ( Can't promise to stop talking about the food though...!)
