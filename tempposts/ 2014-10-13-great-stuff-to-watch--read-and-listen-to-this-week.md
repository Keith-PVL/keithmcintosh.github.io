## 13th October 2014

February 1943. "Moreno Valley,   Colfax County,   New Mexico. Dinnertime on George Mutz's ranch." from the <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/18068">Shorpy Historical Archive. </a>

What's the haps this week, comrades? Full speed term-time around here. One kindy boy who is fully exhausted and ready for his school year to be over, and one seven year old with a birthday in ONLY SIX MORE DAYS, MUM!! Children obsessed with poo and genitals. Keith fighting a cold. I really, really  need to book a leg wax. Banana bread for afternoon tea.

Business as usual!

Some good stuff to check out this week if you're looking for diversion:

Listen: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/550lrKsPK8TCC4Iroa30zU?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open">Mekong Delta Sunrise</a> by Australian hip-hop collective Astronomy Class., which samples Cambodian pop music fro the 50's and 60's. (Check out a bit <a href="https://soundcloud.com/elefanttraks">here </a>too.)

Read: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/901072-operating-instructions-a-journal-of-my-son-s-first-year">Operating Instructions</a> By Anne Lamott - a lovely present for an expecting Mum, and a charming, funny read about a grumpy ex-alcoholic single mother who finds herself surprised and delighted by her newborn's first year.

Watch: <a href="http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/monkey-grip/ZX0413A001S00">Monkey Grip</a>, available on iView. (Non- Aussie readers might need a workaround to view this one.) This superb ode to hairy armpits, bralessness and 70's bohemianism, all set to a Chrissie Amphlett soundtrack, is is adapted from the book by Helen Garner.  Watch the film, and then watch t<a href="http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/helen-garners-monkey-grip/AC1348V001S00">his excellent making-of documentary</a>, which features the wonderful Ms Garner as well many of the real-life people the book's characters were based on.   They tell of being arty inner-city young adults, post-Pill and pre-Aids, grappling with feminism and open relationships and community parenting.

Happy Monday folks! Take off your bra, why don't you. Relax-ay-voo.
