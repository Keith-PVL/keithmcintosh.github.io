# Stoned And Paranoid Police Officers Are Just What You Need

## 20th March 2014

Ah,   it's been a busy week,   I'm out of sorts and my face is feeling squashed and sore and discombobulated. It's processing a new sinus infection, and this one is all the more frustrating considering how well I have been feeling lately - hopped on on long-term antibiotics and daily steroids. Finished the meds,  immediately got sick again.

I'm not sure how I feel about the toss-up between painful, recurring face-flu or constant drugs. Both are sorry choices. I am making my sad face right now. Yesterday Keith told me gently that I had my 'shit-coloured glasses' on. How I laughed! And then cried. And then hit him with a family-sized bar of fruit and nut chocolate.

Plus my back is sore.

Oh and another thing I have my period.

Tomorrow, the ENT, and a face scan.  But tonight, there is nothing for it but to apply some classic YouTube archival goodness: stoned, paranoid police officers. This will make everything a bit better. It cannot fail.

And if you're feeling blue, my love to you.
