# On School Holidays (Or Mayday! Mayday! The Monkeys Have Destroyed The Lab!

## 16th October 2013

This post was first published in Practical Parenting Magazine,   September 2013. I wish I could say that this last school holidays went better than usual,   but what with the lonely tears and the shouting and the measles,   I fear that would be a terrible lie.

Deep breath! The school holidays are upon me like a young Labrador, and I confess, I am not good at school holidays. I start off with the best of intentions; full of enthusiasm and plans for outings and craft and fun, and finish up shriek-weeping ‘Please, I am not a slave! And this is not a hotel!’ Basically I start as Justine Clarke and end as Roseanne Barr. It’s not a pretty transformation, but in my defense it is hard to stay warm, unruffled and nurturing when you have slipped on a piece of discarded toast and ended with Lego wedged painfully in a personal body area.

Nonetheless, I am determined to do better this time, so here I am, week one, setting up what I think of as the Monkey Lab. The primates I am managing are aged six, four and one, and so negotiating play time can be complicated. The six year old wants to make a tricky craft project, and the baby wants to see what that project tastes like, or how it might look when stuffed down the toilet. The four-year-old is generally unpredictable (especially when hopped up on his asthma medication.) I try to make ‘invitations to play’ that suit their different needs: a play dough table, bikes on the deck, a pile of craft materials, a puzzle set up in a corner. I’ve instituted a Holiday Rewards Jar for reinforcing good behaviour, and a Sulky Tax for bad attitudes (ten cents for each incident of sudden shrieking or unreasonable whinging.)

In my head, we have relaxed, fun times together, and sometimes this even comes true. I have moments of pure mama-happiness: here I am in my nest, with my babies, fed and warm and safe. They are so funny, so sweet, such good company. And yet a trap lurks here. Sometimes the Monkey Lab will run so well, the primates so entertained, so happy, that in the thrill of stay-at-home-mum disorder, I start adding stuff to the dangerously groaning smorgasbord of fun. Hey, let’s bake biscuits! I’ll suggest. Let’s plant some rhubarb! Let’s clean out the dress-up box together!

At some point, the kid’s meltdown –meter will start ticking, but buried in the dress-ups, I have found the sewing kit and started mending a broken princess crown. I am off my game. I'm not reading the signs. I'm losing my position at the head of the pack. The bickering rises in volume, and then, out of nowhere, there is an almighty, rising, banshee wail. I look up and suddenly realise the entire house is carpeted in toys and discarded apple cores and puzzle pieces. The mess is obscene, and (thanks to all the craft), it even glitters. Mayday! Mayday! The monkeys have destroyed the lab!

Some parents love the school holidays, I know. They love the break in the morning routine and the chance to chill out in their pajamas all day. Not me, sadly. By the end of the school holidays, I need a good long recovery program based around lying motionless in bed, clutching a hot-water-bottle, applying chocolate to my mouth and watching something compellingly mindless (Dr. Drew’s Celebrity Rehab springs to mind.) Still, positive thinking! These holidays may be the ones where the Monkey Lab runs with pleasing efficiency. I’ll keep you posted.
