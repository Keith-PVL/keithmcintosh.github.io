# Favourite TV Writing Of The Moment (Plus, Jessa From Girls In Real Life: She's Jessa! )

## 25th September 2014

Are you a Girls fan? I am. Keith and I have just finished a leisurely run through season 3. We dragged it out for a while.  Good season.  I love Lena Dunham - I think she's one of the most original and interesting writers of the moment.

In Australia,   I feel the same way about Josh Thomas and <a href="http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/please-like-me/MP1439H118C00DS1">Please Like Me</a>. Do you watch this one? Dunham and Thomas write in similar ways. They mine  their own quirky personalities,   shining  a bravely bright spotlight on their own awkwardness,   and then then branch out to explore relationships and the cultural moment. They always leave me chewing stuff over, and they are both really funny.

Anyway, if you're not a Girls fan, get back to training your falcon or whatever. If you are, check these pictures out. It's Jemima Kirke, the actress who plays Jessa.  And she is **so** Jessa that it's like a parody. I love it.
