# Ordinary Joys (Life In The Beautiful Bubble)

## 3rd September 2014

I sometimes feel an oppressive sense of impending doom hovering above us. Do you feel it? We can't quite touch it,   or see it,   but we can feel it,   a chill in the air, like a spectre just past the horizon. It is whispering of some impending trouble. Big trouble. Final, unspeakable trouble.

I feel it around ISIS, around Putin, around Gaza, around climate change.

At the same time, I feel intense happiness around my little world. My family, my friends, my house. My little place in blogland that brings me so much joy. My beautiful children and the way they shout 'Penis!' and laugh so hard they can't breathe. My husband, who is so dear and so central to my happiness.

Sometimes Keith and I talk about what's happening outside our lives. These worrying, seemingly inexplicable problems that are beyond our scope to solve or even to understand. And then we say to each other 'Ah well. Back to the bubble.'

The bubble is where I live and it is just as real as these problems outside it. In the bubble my worries are small and fleeting, and my joys are profound. I like this poem:

**Make the Ordinary Come Alive**

**Do not ask your children**

**to strive for extraordinary lives.**

**Such striving may seem admirable,**

**but it is a way of foolishness.**

**Help them instead to find the wonder**

**and the marvel of an ordinary life.**

**Show them the joy of tasting**

**tomatoes, apples, and pears.**

**Show them how to cry**

**when pets and people die.**

**Show them the infinite pleasure**

**in the touch of a hand.**

**And make the ordinary come alive for them.**

**The extraordinary will take care of itself.**
