# In Praise Of Knobs

## 27th September 2013

There are hidden benefits to being the kind of half-arsed renovator that allows a year to pass between the first undercoating of the kitchen cupboards and the final screwing on of replacement knobs over a third coat of shiny gloss. You really appreciate the finished product when it' s been a ridiculously long time coming.

No more ugly faux-mahogany kitchen cupboards!

And the end of the  long period of  of prying cupboard doors open from the bottom! It's been hard to find a free weekend to hunker down and finish the job. Other tasks and situations kept bumping it off the priority list. All these kids! And their **needs**! And while spending a few hours on the floor listening to podcasts and painting into the corners is one of my favourite things to do,   it's quite tough on an iffy spine that has taken, this year, to popping out of place when I annoy it.  Top-shelf back-health days have been required to tackle the job, and they have been in short supply.

This week I finally got the job almost finished - at least, all the cupboards painted, and all the knobs screwed on. I tell you, it has been thrilling to open and close these cupboards. And honestly, if I had not been crouched on the floor prying them open  with my fingernails for so many months, I don't think I would appreciate the engineering perfection that is the little knob that levers open a cupboard door.

Knobs!

So many knobs!

When not admiring my knobs today, I listened  to <a href="http://foxslane.blogspot.com.au/">Kate</a> from Foxs Lane<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/lifematters/vantastic/4979368"> talk on Life Matters </a>about the caravan trip she took across Australia with her family last year. Lovely story.

Happy weekending, my friends!  Appreciate your knobs.
