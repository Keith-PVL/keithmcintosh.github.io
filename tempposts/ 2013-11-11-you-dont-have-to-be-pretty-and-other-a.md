## 11th November 2013

<p Â "You don't have to be pretty. You don't owe prettiness to anyone. Not to your boyfriend/spouse/partner,   not to your co-workers,   especially not to random men on the street. You don't owe it to your mother, you don't owe it to your children, you don't owe it to civilization in general. Prettiness is not a rent you pay for occupying a space marked "female".</p>

<p Diana Vreeland.</p>

<p (And when Helen Mirren was asked what she would have taught a daughter, had she had one, she answered 'Two words. Fuck off.'</p>
