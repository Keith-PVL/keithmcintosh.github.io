<div 

<div i carry your heart with me (i carry it in

my heart) i am never without it (anywhere

i go you go,  my dear; and whatever is done

by only me is your doing,   my darling)

<br />

                                                      i fear

<br />



no fate (for you are my fate,my sweet) i want

no world (for beautiful you are my world,my true)

and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant

and whatever a sun will always sing is you

<br />



here is the deepest secret nobody knows

(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud

and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows

higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)

and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

<br />



i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)

May you fall in love today.

Happy Monday!
