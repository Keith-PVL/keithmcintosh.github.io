# Bookshelf: Confessions Of A Slacker Wife

## 3rd December 2013

Impressive title.

But not as impressive as the authors name: Muffy Mead-Ferro.

Apparently this book is a follow up to the best-selling 'Confessions Of A Slacker Mom',   a genre in the the 'Moms That Drink' vein. Often packaged with illustations of sixties-ish looking figures; cocktail glass in one hand, baby dangling from the other. Bit twee for me. I'd rather read 'Moms On Crystal Meth'; less wacky, more misery-memoir.
