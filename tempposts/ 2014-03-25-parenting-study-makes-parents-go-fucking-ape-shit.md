# Parenting Study Makes Parents Go Fucking Ape-Shit

## 25th March 2014

My friend Matt just ruined my morning.

He sent me <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/shouts/2014/03/new-parenting-study-released.html?mobify=0">this goddamn hilarious article</a>,   which outlines a recent study showing that 'if American parents read one more long-form think piece about parenting they will go fucking ape shit.'

<blockquote>The study was conducted by Susan Waterson,   a professor of behavioral psychology at the University of Massachusetts and the author of zero books, because, Waterson says, “another book at this point would just be cruel.” In the course of seven weeks, Waterson interviewed a hundred and twenty-seven families about their reaction to articles that begin with a wryly affectionate parenting anecdote, segue into a dry cataloguing of sociological research enlivened with alternately sarcastic and tender asides, and end with another wryly affectionate anecdote that aims to add a touch of irony or, failing at that, sentimentality. “I wasn’t looking to prove there was too much of this content,” Waterson said. “I’m a behaviorist, not a sociologist. Only one part of this equation interested me—the fucking-ape-shit part.”</blockquote>

The author goes on to give a few examples, like that of Paul Nickman, who was having a coffee in his Californian law office when he happened upon an article about the importance of 'giving kids real challenges.'

<blockquote>“They mentioned this thing called grit, and I was like, ‘O.K, great. Grit.’ Then I started to think about how, last year, I’d read that parents were making kids do too much and strive too hard, and ever since then we’ve basically been letting our kids, who are ten and six, sit around and stare into space.” Nickman called his wife and started to shout, “Make the kids go outside and get them to build a giant wall out of dirt and lawn furniture and frozen peas!” He added, “Get them to scale it, and then make them go to the town zoning board to get it permitted, but don’t let them know it was your idea!” Nickman has no idea how many minutes passed before he realized he was standing in a fountain outside a European Waxing Center, rending his clothes.</blockquote>

The Nickman's began a recovery protocol which involved wearing horse blinders when they left the house and handing other parents a card that read “Please do not talk to me about my children or your children, or children, or schools, or schooling, or learning, or Tae Kwon Do, ballet., etc. Also, please ignore the horse blinders.”

OK, funny. Seriously funny. But!

Readers, I have,  pathetically, just read this as I am sitting down to work on a pitch to a long-form publisher.It's a parenting article that will most likely begin with an affectionate parenting anecdote, segue into a dry cataloguing of sociological research enlivened with alternately sarcastic and tender asides, and end with another wryly affectionate anecdote that aims to add a touch of irony or, failing at that, sentimentality.

Shit, Matt.

Now what do I do?
