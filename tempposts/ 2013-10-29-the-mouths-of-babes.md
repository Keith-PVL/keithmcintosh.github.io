This week:

From horrified 2 year old as she watches me work the neti pot: 'That's escusting! Mama! That's escusting!'

From thoughtful 5 year old,   to both parents: 'When I grow up, I will have a useful job. Not like a scientist or a writer.'

From mischievous 7 year old, in front of school mum I know only a little: Â 'Mum, Why do you say 'fuck' and 'shit' all the time?' (This joke got such a good reaction that she did it again, the next day. .She promised that she wouldn't do it again, but we both did laugh a lot, later. I had to credit her comic timing. )

Life with kids. It's the best.
