Maureen O'Connor from NY Magazine wrote<a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/not-apologize-for-having-loud-sex.html"> in defense of noisy sex</a> this week. Don't worry about the neighbours,   she advises. Have yourself a fine old time, should one be in the offing.

<blockquote>Noisy sex may not be appropriate every time — perhaps you are saving your vocal chords for an upcoming operetta — but it is a reasonable and relatively harmless enhancement.</blockquote>

Also, not sexually specific, but good life advice, nonetheless: O'Connor says not to shout “J’accuse!” at a stranger who farts. I will **not** be making that mistake again.

More hints! Some 'naughty tips'  to avoid:

<ul>

<li>"'slip a doughnut around his penis and eat it off."</li>

<li>“Sprinkle a little pepper under his nose right before he climaxes. Sneezing can feel similar to an orgasm and amplify the feel-good effects.”</li>

<li>“Press a fork (firmly, but don’t break the skin or anything) into different parts of his body—his butt cheeks, his pecs, his thighs.”</li>

</ul>

All of these tips are from Cosmo. Where else? Read the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/10/15_naughty_tips_to_guarantee_bad_sex_partner/">full list </a>here.

And finally, if you're unsure, a word from Science:
