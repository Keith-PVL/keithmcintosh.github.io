# The Sweet Still Moments of Marriage

## 23rd February 2015

What is it?

I wake up, with that inexplicable, magical mother's alarm clock, and switch on the bedside light to stare blinkily at a sleeping Pudding in the bed next to me. I don't  remember her getting in, and as I watch her sleeping,  she makes a yelping sound and throws up, copiously, on my pillow.

Oh.

Kay.

Here we go. The gastro zone.

'**Keith**! I call to the lounge room, where he's still up, working on his algorythms. '**Bowl**!'

He knows what that means (dad of three), and he moves fast. We strip the bed, change Pudding and move our little field hospital to the lounge-room. We tuck the little sweaty, floppy one up with towels and cushions, and settle in together. Every twenty minutes or so, Pudding mutters 'I feel sick', and we sit her up, rub her back and murmur sweet nothings as she vomits.

Keith takes the bowl and washes it out. I wipe down Pudding's hands and face with paper towels and warm water. All the while we wait for the call from the big kids room.  This little radio-play usually gets worse before it gets better.

I put on a load of washing and change Pudding's little bed, and we scrub our hands with hot water and soap every fifteen minutes. Keith plays the piano for us as I tuck Pudding in close. He plays his gentlest classical pieces, and I read to Pudding from the book Raggedy Andy and The Hobby Horse. For a long period, Pudding and I half-sleep between the rising and falling crescendos of her sickness,  while Keith's music fills the room. It's very peaceful.

The vomiting slows and we try to tuck her into our bed but we've jumped the gun - Pudding throws up in the doorway. We change her clothes again, put another load in the machine, return to the MASH unit on the couch. Tucked between us, Pudding is limp and quiet as she listens to Keith make up a long, rambling story, and I read a cookbook on my lap. At some point, we all three fall asleep.

Sometime after 3am, we make it back to the big bed, relieved that the other kids have slept through, and pass out like the zombie dead. At 7am Pudding is bright and perky. 'Make my dretfast! she demands, and haggard and achy, I comply.

It's been years now that Keith and I have been engaged in these routines. The heart of our life together is with our three children, and when one of them is sick, everything else fades away. There's a beauty to it, a simplicity. They need us, all the everyday stuff drops away, and it is in these moments that marriage is so beautiful.

(Spew n all.)

Time keeps on ticking. The bottle of  hand sanitizer is still on the arm of the couch, Monday has already raced away with the week, and life rushes forward, forward, forward. But  much as I would have loved to stay asleep at midnight last Friday, and save my little buddy from her pain and discomfort,  I feel the beauty and the romance of that quiet room, caring for a sick little one and listening to Keith play piano, and I cherish the sweetness of the memory.
