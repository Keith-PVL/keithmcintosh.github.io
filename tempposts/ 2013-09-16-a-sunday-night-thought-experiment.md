# A Sunday Night Thought Experiment

## 16th September 2013

Perhaps it is because married a scientist that I have such regard for those who dream of solutions to the problems of the world. Or maybe it's the other way around.

I read somewhere once that physicists were eternal optimists; seeing any problem as a challenge to be solved,   rather than defeated by. I have also always loved the term 'thought experiment'. It's so playful. **Anything** could happen in a thought experiment.

This Ted talk explores the idea of what might happen if we put our wild, lost ecosystems back together, like America did to some degree with the wolves of Yellowstone Park.

And this week, I was struck by this story that showed how the great minds at Microsoft <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/09/13/microsoft_concept_videos_from_2000_predict_tech_trends_microsoft_missed.html   ">predicted every great tech breakthrough</a> since 2000, but missed the business boat on all of them. **All of them, ** the poor bastards. So you have to have the dream, and then you have to do the things.

My thought experiment for tonight: how might I feel this time next week if I get up at six every morning to write, do yoga every day and get to bed by 9.30 every night?  (It's 9.27 as I type this, by the way.) Such is my plan. In this thought experiment, I am in my full shabby glorious prime, ripe with possibility, ready to make the most of my one wild and precious etc etc etc.

I shall report in next week on the outcomes of the actual clinical trial.

Have a thrilling week!
