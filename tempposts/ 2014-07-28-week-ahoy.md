# Week Ahoy!

## 28th July 2014

A pig eating a cookie.

 

Starting with Hair and then Keith and I reied to work out Forever Young (honky tonk etc).

May you have a pro

 

This morning I've been to the gym (not my natural habitat) and I did not hit m,  sef in the face with the equopiment like last week. Win! I went to Aldi stopped myslef from butying a sous-vide machine (Aldi,   you eveil genuises. You're killing me.) and basically worked outGAIN tryingh to keep up with the wild swifness of the chekout girl. Â Win!

Tonight, potato gratin.

In general, I am praxticing the art of not complaning. (So far, so good.)

My hope for you isthat every morning this week begins as sweetly as it does for this pig eating a cookie.
