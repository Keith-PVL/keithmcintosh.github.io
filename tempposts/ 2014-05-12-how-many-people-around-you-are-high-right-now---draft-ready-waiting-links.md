## 12th May 2014

Heaps,   according to This American Life. They're everywhere! A great episode.

More good listening:

Richard Fidler interviews <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/04/22/3989846.htm?site=conversations">Jennifer Saunders</a>.

My eternal girlfriend <a href="http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/whnews/whnews_20140502-1000a.mp3">Caitlin Moran</a> on BBC 4's Woman's Hour talks about teaching her small daughter to shout 'Damn the patriarchy!' whenever she stubs her toe.

An interesting exploration of the mysterious <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/how-gypsies-work/">history of the 'gypsies' or Roma people </a> from the boys at Stuff You Should Know.

An excelent interview with Jean Kittson on the menospaose: why the historical silence? 'If women became angry and irritable, they were locke up. If men becoem angry and irritabe, theyu were elected to Parliament. '

Go forth, and make happy your ears, my friends!
