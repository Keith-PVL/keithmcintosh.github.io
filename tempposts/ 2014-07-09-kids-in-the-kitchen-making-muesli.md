# Kids in The Kitchen: Making Muesli

## 9th July 2014

Muesli (or granola) is such a great thing to make with the kids. It's all tipping stuff out of jars,   mixing and measuring, getting hands sticky. Excellent fun. Hard to bugger up. And although the cleanup can be epic,   the payoff is delicious. A weeks worth of yummy whole-food satisfaction.

Here's my recipe.

**Ingredients**

6 cups rolled oats

2 cups dessicated coconut

1 cup wheatgerm

1/2 cup LSA (linseed, soy, almond meal)

I cup chopped nuts (peanuts, walnuts, almonds)

1/2 cups raw cacao nibs

1/2 cup pepitas

1 cup of dried berries

!/2 cup chopped dried apricots

Really, it's just about a bowl full of grain, nut and seed goodness. I just superboost that bad boy with whatever I have in the pantry (or can vacuum from the bottom of my handbag.)

**Method**

1. Preheat oven on low (160 degrees)

2. Get your little soux chef to mix all your dry ingredients together  in a great big bowl. (Do not look at the floor after they do this. It's chaos. It's a car crash. It's the Costa Concordia. But it's recoverable. )

2. For the syrup, take  1 cup of honey, half a cup of raw sugar, a quarter cup of coconut oil and a quarter cup of butter. Melt this gently over a low heat until deliciously dissolved.

3. Do this part yourself (it's hot) : pour the syrup over the dry mix, and using a spoon first and then hands, squish the mixture until it forms a great big squidgy, sticky mess that has all been slightly coated with syrup.

4. Get a couple of big baking trays (you may need three), line with baking paper and press the mix down firmly to fill the tray right to the corners. This is a great job for little hands.

5. Bake the trays for ten minutes or so, until the tops of the mix are browning slightly. Let them cool on the countertop and then decant it all into a big container. Admire this with pride and satisfaction. DO NOT look at the mess on the floor until you've had a nice cup of tea and restored your energy.

6. Eat with pleasure (We like it with Greek yogurt, bananas and the inner glow of gastronomical smugness.)

7.  You had better deal with that floor now.
