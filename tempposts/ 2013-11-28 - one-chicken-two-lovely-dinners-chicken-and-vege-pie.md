# One Chicken, Two Lovely Dinners: Chicken and Vege Pie

## 28th Whoops 2013

Hello again,   my carnivore friends.

Are you feeling delightfully post-prandial after last night's <a href="http://mogantosh.com/one-chicken-two-lovely-dinners-roast-chicken-with-lemon/">roast chicken</a>? Did you make your stock,   strain it into a bowl and store it in the fridge? Good job.

Tonight,   dinner is a chicken pie with veges. This is a recipe that you can adapt, depending on how many veges you have in the fridge, how well you have planned this meal in advance, and how greedy your family was with the chicken last night.

Hokay.

First, preheat your oven to 180 degrees and take a sheet of frozen puff pastry out of the freezer and leave it to thaw while you get started on the pie mix.

Sweat off an onion and some diced garlic in a pan with olive oil and a nice chunk of butter. You can grate a small potato in too, if you like (a CWA trick.) Slice some mushrooms, turn up the heat a little and fry them off, giving lots of room to spread out.

Sprinkle over a good tablespoon of cornflour and cook it off for a few minutes, then then add about 600 mls of chicken stock (a good few cups.)

When the mix is thickening well (add more flour if it isn't),  throw in a couple of handfuls of diced veges: carrot, zucchini, potato - really, whatever you like, whatever you have. Frozen peas are fine too. Chop up any leftover roasted veges you have from last night and throw them in there, and then add whatever chicken you have left.

In a cup, mix up one beaten egg, half a cup of cream and a good tablespoon of Dijon mustard, then stir this through your pie mix. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper.

Fill a good sized pie dish with the mixture, and cover the top with your pastry, tearing in and filling the edges as you need. (You can make a little design on top if you like. 'Mum is awesome' in gothic lettering would be very, very impressive. ) Pop some holes in with a fork, and then glaze the top with the leftover cream mixture from your cup.

Bake for about 2o minutes, or until the pastry is lovely and golden. This pie is quite rich, so a crisp green salad is perfect on the side.

This is a forgiving recipe.  You can change up the veges, and even leave out many of the steps if you are pushed for time.

Last night, for instance, a bastard fraudster rang in the middle of my dinner prep and tried to convince me that my bank account had been hacked. It took me a while to sort out what was happening, and as a result, I ran out of time to get truly fancy. So I fried some mushrooms in butter, threw the chicken in, added chicken stock and stirred some flour through until it seemed saucy. It was still good, although if you subscribe to the theory that your emotions enter the food you cook, it must have tasted disturbingly like impotent lady- rage.

Thanks again to the chicken.

Now, my friends, riddle me these:

a) Do you like the fancy new look of this here blog ? Contact <a href="http://garnishgarden.com/">Chrystie </a>if you need a designer.

b) Do you have a favourite trick with chicken? I would love to hear it.

c) As I muttered angrily to myself after the phone call, I decided that should I ever be suss about a call asking for my computer security details, I'm going to say to them 'I am a dark witch, and this curse means you will never truly be loved.'  Do you have a better one?
