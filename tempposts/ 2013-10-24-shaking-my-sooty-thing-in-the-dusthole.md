# Shaking My Sooty Thing In The Dusthole

## 24th October 2013

This week,   I spent some time scrubbing filth from the inside of the car. It was a fetid,   stinky job,   and I found myself feeling simultaneously virtuous at my cleaning freny , and horried at the slobby behaviour that had led to that stibky place. I thought of it as 'emotional multi-tasking'.

I suspect I'm like lots of people in that I love my nest to be sparkly, welcoming and clean, but I my attitude to the processes that get it that way less than inspired.

I have spent my morning trying to stem the tide of filth that turns 'comfortable' (shabby) home into public health hazard. Everywhere I look:  magazines, matchbox cars, apple cores, dust bunnies. I like to blame the children, and the husband who works so hard,  but, really, it's me. I am just too lazy to properly step up to the amount of work that's needed to keep a household of five scrubbed and tidy, glinting with the freshness of Scandinavia.

This week, I've been re-reading the fabulous <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507825-at-home">At Home</a> written by that delightful big old teddy bear Bill Bryson.

If you love the details of domestic life, you will adore the daily jobs-list of Hannah Culwick, English servant, 1840:

<blockquote>Opened the shutters &amp; lighted the kitchen fire. Shook my sooty thing in the dusthole &amp; emptied the soot there. Swept &amp; dusted the rooms &amp; the hall. Laid the hearth &amp; got breakfast up. Clean’d 2 pairs of boots. Made the beds &amp; emptied the slops. Clean’d &amp; washed the breakfast things up. Clean’d the plate, clean’d the knives &amp; got dinner up. Clean’d away. Clean’d the kitchen up; unpack’d a hamper. Took 2 chickens to Mrs. Brewers &amp;brought the message back. Made a tart &amp; pick’d &amp; gutted 2 ducks and roasted them. Clean’s the steps and flags on my knees. Wash’d up in the scullery. Clean’d the pantry on my knees &amp; scour’d the tables. Scrubbed the flags around the house &amp; clean’d the windowsills. Got tea for the Master and Mrs. Warwick…Clean’d the privy &amp; Passage &amp; Scullery floor on my knees. Wash’d the dog &amp; clean’d the sinks down. Put the supper ready for Ann to take up, for I was too dirty &amp; tired to go upstairs. Wash’d in a bath &amp; to bed.</blockquote>

A typical day for Hannah, unusual only in that she managed a bath, unlike most days where she wrote:  ‘Slept in my dirt.’

<p First thought: God, what a soft, middle class fanny I am. I would not last a second in the nineteenth century.</p>

Second thought: Why does 'shook my sooty thing in the dusthole' sound so filthy? God, I am so low-brow. I would not last a second in the nineteenth century.

Third thought: Hannah went into service at age eight. This is terrible, or course. **Awful**. And yet...I've got a seven year old. It costs me a good ten bucks in stickers and much exhausting Wiggles-level-enthusiastic praise to get her to make her bed. Is it so wrong to take on a few ideas?

How wrong?
