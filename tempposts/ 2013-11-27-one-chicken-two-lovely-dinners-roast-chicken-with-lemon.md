# One Chicken, Two Lovely Dinners: Roast Chicken With Lemon

## 27th November 2013

I am a crazy fool for menu planning. I like to cook,   I like to think about cooking, I like to write menus up on my little blackboard, and I love the feeling of  gazing upon a full pantry after a grocery shop. Come on, zombie apocalypse, I think in those moments. Come and get me.

Most weeks, I roast a chicken. The kids will eat everything up with no dramas, which makes for a pleasant dinner table, and a roast is always a pleasingly festive meal to dish up. Good for the soul. (Sadly, not so good for the chicken.)

Look away, vegetarians.

When I roast a chicken, I make the bird last across two of our favourite dinners, even though free-range and organic chickens tend to be smaller.  Today, I'll write up my roasted chicken recipe, and then tomorrow, I'll post my chicken pie. Whether you like it or not, people!

To get dinner on the table at six, the chicken needs to go in the oven before 4.30; so it's not a quick cook, but the prep is simple. There's really no need to wash the chicken  (unlike Adrienne from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, so unfamiliar with the kitchen that she washed her chook in HAND SOAP. One of my favourite TV moments ever. <a href="http://jezebel.com/5853092/how-many-housewives-does-it-take-to-cook-a-chicken">Here it is.</a> Watch it and come back.)

Oh hai!

Slice some little holes in the skin of your bird, and poke big chunks of butter in there. Give the chicken a good massage with some chopped garlic and some olive oil. Really get into it. Finally, quarter a lemon, squeeze the juice over the chicken and then tuck the quarters up its bum, along with some more butter. You don't need to buy it a drink first. It's already dead.

Sorry, vegetarians.

Here's a chicken ready for the oven. Note all the mess. It's 4.30 crazy hour. Many activities in progress.

Salt and pepper all over, and then into the oven (preheated at 200 degrees.) Sit your chicken in a baking tray on its side, and then set the timer for 20 minutes. When the timer goes off, flip it onto the other side. You can add a little more olive oil if you like. Then, another 20 minutes, and flip onto it's back, so the juices run down into the breast.  You may need a final 20 minutes, depending on the size of your chook. It will be done when you poke in a fork at the thickest point and the juices run clear.

While the chicken is in its first cooking session, chop up whatever veges you have at hand, spread them out across a baking tray and give them all a good drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Carrots love a little honey, too.

When the chicken is ready, put it on a plate to rest, and put the whole baking tray across a burner of your stove. Add a cup or so of water, a good heaped tablespoon of flour, a dash of balsamic, and mix it all up with a wooden spoon. Really get the crusty bits off the bottom. (They are the best bits.) You might need a little more water, but gravy is a delightfully inexact science - every batch is different, ad they re all delicious. You might like red wine in there, or verjuice, or high-grade Argentinian cocaine. It's your life! Follow your dreams!

Eat, as the K-Dog would have it, until your stomach is hurting quite a lot.

At the end of dinner, pick the leftover meat off the bird and put in the fridge, then make a quick chicken stock while you wash up and negotiate pajamas and books and games of Uno.

Just throw the carcass and bones, a carrot, an onion, a bay leaf and whatever other herbs you have into a casserole dish, cover with cold water and simmer gently for a couple of hours. This stock will give delicious flavour to tomorrows pie.

Bon appetit!

And sincere thanks to the chicken.
