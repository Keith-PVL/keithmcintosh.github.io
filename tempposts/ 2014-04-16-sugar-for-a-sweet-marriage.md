Stop!

Don't quit sugar!

Science says its <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2014/04/unhappy-marriages-due-low-blood-sugar">bad for your marriage.</a>

In a 21-day study of 107 married couples in the US,   researchers found decreased blood glucose levels,   decreased self-control and increased aggressive behaviour toward participants’ spouses. Participants were given  voodoo dolls and pins (!) and asked to record their anger levels at different times of day.

In particular, spouses with lower **evening** sugar levels showed increased aggression towards their special someone.

So there you go! Put the kids to bed, whip out the  Old Jamaican Rum and Raisin and give your spouse a great big kiss.

Science says.
