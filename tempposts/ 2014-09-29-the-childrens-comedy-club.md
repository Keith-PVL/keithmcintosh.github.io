# The Children's Comedy Club

## 29th September 2014

How are your holidays going,   parents?

We're trucking along. A tiny invisible horse has it's bony foot in my back on a pretty constant basis lately. That sentence is a bit wrong,   but fuck it,   so is my  spine. On the good side of the ledger, the weather is glorious, I dipped my toes in the Pacific today, and yesterday I even got out my sewing machine and made the TV some velvet curtains.

Mushroom pie for dinner tonight, flowers in jars everywhere (spring!) and some time spent with my sister visiting from the country  always makes me happy.  As  always, my back might make me frown, but the kids make me laugh. And now, a pile of unfolded washing, a cup of tea and a little iView awaits.

Spending time with small children is a little like getting a front-row seat at a sort of open mic improvisational comedy club. Kids are big on observational humour – all day long, they share thoughts about life, comments on people around them and questions about the natural order of things. Often, they don’t know how funny they are being.

My five year old T-Bone has taken to making announcements like ‘Tasmania was the third country in the world to invent pizza.’ When we ask where he gets his information, he taps his head solemnly and says ‘My brain tells me.’ This brain thinks outside the box. ‘Wouldn’t it be good if a robber came but all he stole was your sinus infection, Mummy? And then he couldn't even rob anymore, because he had a sinus infection?'

After school yesterday we had a discussion about rude words (prompted by an incident where two year old Pudding called me a ‘fart-bastard’.) ‘I know a really rude word you can’t say to someone,’ T-Bone told me. ‘It’s ‘can’t.’

‘Can’t?’ I asked him carefully. ‘Who called you a ‘can’t’?’ He tapped his head. ‘My brain told me. Like if you say “You can’t do that, you’re stupid.”’ I agreed that it was important to be careful about that word. Also, you had to choose your moment for ‘fart-bastard’.

Young Pudding is a constant source of amusement to us. She lives in a land of surreal imagination. Recently she told me ‘I hope the mans comes and takes your teefs out so you can’t talk.’ This seemed unnecessarily harsh to me. I only told her she had to put a jumper on.

She’s become very interested in gender, and she splits everything into ‘boy stuff’ and ‘girl stuff’. For instance, the number four is a ‘boy number’ and all the other numbers are girl numbers. Coloured washcloths are boys and white ones are girls. There is one ‘girl knob’ in the kitchen and all the other drawers have ‘boy knobs.’ (These jokes just write themselves.) Along with her dawning understanding of gender, she’s become super interested in genitals. At a family party on the weekend, my mother in law filmed around the table with her iPad. Everybody smiled and waved, but not young Pudding. No, she announced ‘I’ve dot a gina!’ and lifted up her skirt. ‘And here it is!’ she shouted with pride.

For my birthday, seven year old Peanut wrote me a poem that read, in part: ‘*I hope you will never forget, our love and no regrets, or the smelliness of Dad’s bum, never ever is you Mum.*’ Ah, bless her little heart. She asked me at the dinner table last night, deadly serious, ‘What is a head-butt anyway, Mum? Is it where someone sticks their head up your bum?’

I laughed until I cried. The comedy at my house is not highbrow. In fact there is more talk of poo and wee and ‘ginas than at an emergency urology clinic. It’s lowbrow, but it’s constant. And I may be just a fart-bastard, but to my mind, the more laughter there is in a house, the better for the people in it. Kids are hard work and they need you to drive them everywhere and sometimes they vomit on you and don’t even apologise, but there is no denying that living with them is funny. It’s really delightfully funny.
