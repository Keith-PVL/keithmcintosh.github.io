# bookshelf - awesome naturfe

## 2nd July 2014

The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger is a wonderfully written piece of narrative non-fiction about an epic storm that hit the fishing trawler Andrea Gail outside Massachusetts in 1991. Detailed,   meticulous and powerful, it's a thrilling read. Junger's powers of description tackle life at home in a small port town:

<blockquote>“There are houses in Gloucester where grooves have been worn into the floorboards by women pacing past an upstairs window, looking out to sea.”</blockquote>

and he really gets his teeth into the awesome, terrifying powers of a massive storm at sea.

<blockquote>“Unfortunately for Mariners, the total amount of wave energy and storm does not rise linearly with wind speed, but to its fourth power. The seas generated by a 40 knot wind aren’t twice as violence as those from a 20 knot wind, they are seventeen times as violent. The ship’s crew watching the anemometer climb even 10 knots could well be watching their death sentence.”</blockquote>

A great present for outdoorsy types, this book.

**Touching The Void** by Joe Simpson describes a terrifying climbing trip gone wrong in Peru. At 21, 000 feet, he  fell into a crevasse and his partner Simon Yates was forced to cut the rope he dangled from, just moments before he too would have died. Over the next three days Simpson struggled down to Base Camp - frostbitten, starving, and with a broken leg. His detailed memories of the journey are compelling and beautifully expressed.

**127 Hours: Between A Rock And A Hard Place** is another triumph of spirit. Aron Ralston was a full-on mountain-biking, snow-boarding, rock-climbing adventure junkie when he went hiking alone in a remote Utah canyon. It was all going swimmingly until an 365 kilo  boulder trapped his arm against a wall. Over the next three days, Ralston ran out of food and water as he tried to come up with any way of saving his life other than amputating his own arm with a pocketknife. All options failed, and he did, eventually, do the job. He survived. The book follows, hour by hour, his thoughts as he contemplates his past and his terrifying present. It's a cracking read, even though you know what's going to happen at the end.

Alive In The Death Zone by Australian mountaineer Lincoln Hall tells the story of his near-death from cerebral oedema at the summit of Everest. The night he spent spend waiting for death and his surreal trip down the mountain the next day make for a fascinating tale. (Hall lost fingers and toes from frostbite after this climb, but survived. He died of mesothelioma in 2008. )
