# Lena Dunham on Feminism, Bad Boyfriends and Woody Allen

Are you a fan of the HBO series Girls? I am. I find it occasionally hit-and-miss,   and I enjoy this lack of polish; this rough,   unfinished charm. More than the show itself,   I am a huge fan of its creator Lena Dunham. She was recently interviewed by comic Mark Maron on his long-running podcast WTF, and Dunham is candid, courteous and thoughtful as she discusses her relationship history and her fascinating childhood (she grew up as a New York art scene kid, with two artist parents). She's particularly interesting on Woody Allen.

This interview took me on the weekend happily through one bathroom cleaning session, one pile of washing up and five bed-strippings. I hope it brings you as much joy! You can <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_479_-_lena_dunham">listen here. </a>

Also, here, a golden gem:  Lena Dunham, age eleven (as well as fourteen-year-old Jemima Kirke, who went on to play Jessa in Girls), <a href="http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/childs-play-lena-dunham-and-jemima-kirkes-first-appearance-in-vogue/#1">featured in Vogue</a> as mini-fashionistas to watch. Kirke's boho cool and Dunham's quirky, serious-minded charm are already apparent.

<blockquote>"I never let my children wear Prada," says **Lorraine Kirke,** an interior designer whose daughters' style is causing a few waves in the fashion world. "Did I say they never wear Prada? Jemima went to school today in a Prada coat. Mine. I said to her, 'You're not wearing that to school.' She just said, 'Why not?' and that was that." Jemima is twelve, and her wardrobe makes **Clueless** look like Kmart. She saunters around her parents' apartment in a pair of seventies patchwork trousers worn low-slung, a cashmere sweater from a flea market, and Adidas sneakers. She's got a blue streak in her blonde hair and glitter on her eyelids. Very Fiona Apple. Sister Lola, seven, wanders in, clad in army pants, those luminous Nikes, and a khaki stripy top. She looks like something out of a hip Gap ad. (It turns out she is in a hip Gap ad.) These two are already learning the rules that get you on the Best Dressed List. "My daughters tell me Prada is too expensive," says Lorraine, who's also shod in the luminous Nikes. "They say, 'Would you have bought that if it wasn't Prada, Mom?' "

There's no Prada allowed in one downtown household. **Laurie Simmons** and **Carroll Dunham'**s eleven-year-old daughter, Lena, has a street edge that could leave even Miss Schnabel feeling momentarily inadequate. "I tried to model this after Helmut Lang," says Lena, showing off a shift she sewed herself. Her fashion pronouncements are something you'd expect from a woman (at least) three times her age: "I tend not to go for trends. You can only wear them for two weeks . . . . I really like Jil Sander, but it's so expensive.... I find Calvin Klein really hard to respect because he's everywhere. I view him as a clothesmonger . . . . Manolo is really classy." Then she returns to preteen reality—"But five dollars a week [i.e., her allowance] isn't really enough. I'm just looking."
