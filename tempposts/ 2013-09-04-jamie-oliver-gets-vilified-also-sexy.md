# Jamie Oliver Gets Vilified, Also Sexy

## 4th September 2013

It's been an emotionally intense week for poor old Jamie Oliver. He's been copping it left and right over comments he made about his new book 'Save With Jamie',   and accused of being a classist,   arrogant rich bastard.   'I’m not judgemental', said Jamie, 'but I’ve spent a lot of time in poor communities, and I find it quite hard to talk about modern-day poverty. You might remember that scene in Ministry of Food, with the mum and the kid eating chips and cheese out of styrofoam containers, and behind them is a massive fucking TV. It just didn’t weigh up.'

Jamie's thoughts weren't received well by all,  including one on<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/30/jamie_oliver_s_classism_the_naked_chef_is_not_the_right_person_to_teach.html">e critic</a> from Slate Magazine who had some illuminating thoughts on the  psychology of poverty.

<blockquote>What I had not understood before I found myself in true poverty, and what Oliver probably does not, is that it means living in a world of “no.” Ninety-nine per cent of what you need is answered “no.” Ninety-nine per cent of what your kids ask for is answered “no.” Ninety-nine per cent of life is answered “no.” Cinema? No. Night out? No. New shoes? No. Birthday? No. So, if the only indulgence that is viable, that is within budget, that will not mean you have to walk to work, is a Styrofoam container of cheesy chips, the answer is a thunderous “YES.”</blockquote>

Still, I was happy to hear Jamie <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b039c5cz/features/singapore-noodles">defend himself on BBC4 Woman's Hour</a> this week, where  he smacked down his critics with charm and spirit while throwing together some Singapore noodles.  I love him. I think he is an exceptional human, a brilliant, passionate philanthropist, victim to that uptight modern expectation that our every hero should be above reproach. He's only uman, as Kath Day-Knight would say. He's allowed to accidentally talk like a bit of an arsehole sometimes. He's my boyfriend.

Also, this.
