Australia's oldest man kmits jumpers for penguins: (great pics here too) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11405280/PICS-AND-PUB-PLS-Australias-oldest-person-reveals-he-spends-his-time-knitting-jumpers-for-penguins-penguin.html

That Tree Change for dolls piece (see mogantosh fb)

 

One of the most epic love stories,  Oscar and Bosie: http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/385434/creative-ideas-happen-when-you-stop-checking-your-phone/

 

notes for me:

Column: The Secret Life Of Marrieds...(for ideas maybe? column to pitch post PP?) http://www.cosmopolitan.com/author/1679/jane-marie/

It's all interviews - this is a really, really cool idea; start with a few interviews and get the ball rolling, then send it out to places on sepc.

 

eg - matt and shirin, carly and adam, al and hall, sam and chris even...

 

Behins Closed Doors, B=etween The Sheets, The Marriage Insider...
