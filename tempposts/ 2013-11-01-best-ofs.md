# Best Ofs

## 1st November 2013

Here's what I approve of this week:

Best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MKikHxKeodA?rel=0">desk</a>.

Best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nIsCs9_-LP8">baby.</a>

Best <a href="http://arbroath.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/australian-tv-presenter-caught-on-live.html">accidental caught-on-tape.</a>

Best <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGxFJ5nL9gg">impassioned rant</a>.

Best <a href="http://gawker.com/christian-science-church-looks-like-a-giant-dick-from-s-1454084292?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pulsenews">view from above.</a>

This weekend,   I'm going to put the final coat of paint and the golden knobs on my hot pink bathroom cabinet,   pull together a Dracula costume for Peanut (she is dying to use her new blood capsules), get up early every morning to work on my book (first draft finished this month, I have promised myself), and generally ferry kids around the joint. I'm hoping to watch Behind The Candelabra with K tomorrow night, and I'm deep in toilet-training land with little Pudding. It's all about the potty treats and the wildly enthusiastic response to poo and wee this week.

Plus, sometime tomorrow, we Â take delivery of a new piano! Oh yes.

Happy weekending, my friends. I hope yours is filled with fake blood, not real, and golden knobs (of whichever kind you most desire.).
