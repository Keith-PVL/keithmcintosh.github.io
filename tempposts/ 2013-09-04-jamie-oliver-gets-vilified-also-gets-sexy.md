# Jamie Oliver Gets Vilified, Also Gets Sexy

## 4th September 2013

It's been an emotionally intense week for poor old Jamie Oliver. He's been copping it left and right for his new series 'Save With Jamie',   which some critics have slammed for being a classist, rich-bastard take down of the poor and their bad eating habits. It must be a little bit difficult for Jamie to have an authentic understanding of how it is to live on the breadline, seeing as how he lives on the chia-enhanced, kale-crusted sourdough-line himself.

<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/08/30/jamie_oliver_s_classism_the_naked_chef_is_not_the_right_person_to_teach.html">One critic</a> has some illuminating thoughts on the  psychology of poverty says

<blockquote>What I had not understood before I found myself in true poverty, and what Oliver probably does not, is that it means living in a world of “no.” Ninety-nine per cent of what you need is answered “no.” Ninety-nine per cent of what your kids ask for is answered “no.” Ninety-nine per cent of life is answered “no.” Cinema? No. Night out? No. New shoes? No. Birthday? No. So, if the only indulgence that is viable, that is within budget, that will not mean you have to walk to work, is a Styrofoam container of cheesy chips, the answer is a thunderous “YES.”</blockquote>

I was happy to hear Jamie <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b039c5cz/features/singapore-noodles">defend himself on BBC4 Womans Hour</a> this week. I love him. I think he is an exceptional human, victim to the modern-day demons that make us deify every person we love. They are famous - therefore they should be above reproach. Like Bill Clinton - he had the raging testosteronic ego that drove him to be the leader of the Free World.

Also, because we're talking about Jamie, I can't resist adding this.
