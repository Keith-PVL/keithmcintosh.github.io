Friends,   don’t believe all the horror stories about parenting two-year-olds. It’s true that it might be, as a friend told me once, ‘like hanging out with your best friend who is drunk all the time’, but it holds many charms. Two year olds have one foot in babyland; clutching their stuffed toys and blankies, being sung to sleep, and needing you so intimately. But they have the other foot planted in childhood too. They repeat what you say (which can be awkward when you’ve had a rough day and they start parroting ‘Fock! Fock!) they try out odd and hilarious behaviours, and most wonderfully, their personality really begins to flower and reveal itself.

Toddlers are like sophisticated animatronic robots designed for maximum cuteness, where even the tantrums are funny. Maybe I am more relaxed this time round, or maybe this child is navigating the emotional and physical changes of toddlerhood more calmly than my other two, but I definitely had more dramas with Peanut and T-Bone.

Imaginative, energetic Peanut was so unpredictable at two that I took to strapping her into a little leash when we went out on the town. I remember one day at the post office, she wanted to play a game where she opened the fridge door, touched all the milk and shut it again. When asked to stop, she threw herself on the floor and wailed with abandon, before trying to run out the door and being stopped abruptly by her leash, like a wilful puppy on a choke chain. Unfortunately this move sent her sideways where her head stopped the momentum by connecting with the lolly counter. I could only stop the shrieking that followed by applying the forbidden delights of Cherry Ripe.

T-Bone at two insisted his name was Trixie-Jeff, and was such a love-sponge that no amount of cuddling and carting around was ever enough. When I could pry him off my hip, I limped to the osteopaths office for re-adjustment and wallet-lightening.

Life with Pudding is all comedy. At the medical centre, she borrows my glasses and reads out loud from an old copy of Woman’s Day. ‘Once a tona pime baby go doc doc. Ear hurts the end.’ She turns the page and nods to me solemnly. ‘Once a tonna pime baby go doc doc. Ear hurts the end.’ And so on.

‘I hangwy your bag!’ Pudding says when we’re out and about. She knows there is usually some sort of snack in there. One day she starts wailing from the back seat. ‘I hangwy your bag Mama!’ she sobs. I ferret out a bit of vegemite sandwich. She keeps crying as she eats it. ‘I still hangwy! I still hangwy!’ she sobs. I pass back another little square. Things go quieter in the back as she munches away. A minute later, a small voice. ‘I no cwying, Mama!’ she says, surprised. ‘That’s true,’ I agree. ‘I no hangwy too,’ she adds, thoughtful. I am delighted to watch this little moment of dawning understanding.

For little Pudding, so new and fresh, the world is a cornucopia of pleasures, a fun park, a cabinet of curiosities waiting to be explored. ‘I like dis! I like dis!’ she says all day. Pudding approaches life with open arms, and it gives to her in abundance. Hard work it may be, raising a toddler, but it’s such beautiful work to have.
