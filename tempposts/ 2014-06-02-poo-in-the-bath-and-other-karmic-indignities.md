# Poo In The Bath and Other Karmic Indignities

## 2nd June 2014

1. It was just yesterday that I said to Keith 'Gee,   we haven't had a poo in the bath for a long time.' Well played,   karma,   I thought tonight as I disinfected my happy place.* Nicely done.

2. Recently T-Bone said to me 'When Daddy is dead, let's put the cover of Plants Versus Zombies' on his gravestone. I was moved. Honours come no higher than this.

3. Two-year-old Pudding experiences every emotion with full-bodied commitment. Last week, on the way home from Nanna and Pop's house, she was wracked with heartbroken sobs because she realised that she had forgotten to replyÂ 'Don't forget your toilet paper' to Pop's 'see ya later, alligator.'

*this is not a euphemism for the white-wine-vinegar vinegar douche I give my lady garden every Saturday night. I promise never to be coy when I do get around to a full tutorial on this.
