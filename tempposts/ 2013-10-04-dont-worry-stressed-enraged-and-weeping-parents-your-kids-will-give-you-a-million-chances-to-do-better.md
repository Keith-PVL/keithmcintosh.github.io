# Don't Worry, Stressed, Enraged and Weeping Parents! Your Kids Will Give You A Million Chances To Do Better

## 4th October 2013

Alain de Botton said it: Of all the excruciating varieties of guilt,   none quite rivals that at having fallen short as a parent.

I'm very keen to read the book  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10353369-the-whole-brain-child?from_search=true">The Whole Brain Child</a> after listening to an interview with author and psychotherapist Tina Payne Bryson <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/08/30/3837421.htm?&amp;section=article&amp;date=(none)">on Conversations recently</a>. Her work draws on paediatric neurology research to explain  the way children's brains work, and  how best we can parent,  in order that our kids grow up strong, healthy, and capable of earning a salary adequate to buying their parents a beach house.

I've thought a lot about her ideas. Two aspects of Payne Bryson's work have have stuck with me: first, that parents need to step up and do their best parenting when it is hardest, and secondly, that it's OK  to fail. Our kids will give us constant chances to model appropriate and nurturing behaviour. Fail, try again. Fail, try again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

Every time we model appropriate behaviour, we help our children  to lay down neural pathways - practiced responses-  that strengthen over time. These 'maps' define how our children respond to stress,  make decisions, and treat others. In short, how well they live.

It's important to be a good parent always (never a day off, drats) but it's when kids are in meltdown that we need to do our best work. Payne Bryson talks about learning to manage tantrums according to their origin - either the 'upstairs (logical, manipulative) brain or the 'downstairs'  (instinctive, primitive) brain.

<span If the meltdown originates in the 'downstairs brain', it means the child has become flooded with emotion and stress hormones. They are overwhelmed with feelings that they can't manage. In these times, you need to move close, contain and nurture the child, helping them to calm down with your words, your tone, and even the physiological aspects of your closeness like your heartbeat and breathing. </span>

An 'upstairs' tantrum - stemming from the more sophisticated, strategic brain-  is one where the child is aiming for a certain result. Don't negotiate with terrorism, says Payne Bryson. Stay firm. Hold your ground, no matter how intense the attack.

Easier than it sounds, especially if the meltdown is happening in public and your instinct is to run away shouting  'Whose child is that? Not mine not mine!' or hiss with rising volume through gritted teeth 'Stop this right now I am warning you no playdates ever no TV for the rest of your life I am feeding your dessert to the dog as soon as s we get home!''

Take a breath, this information says to me, and stay outside the fray. Keep your emotional shit together, especially at the hardest times. There is nothing so discombulating, so stressful, as a child having a full-blown meltdown. It's  a big ask that in the moment of crisis, we think through what's going on, stay calm and react accordingly. Do your best, says Payne Bryson, but know this: if you fail this time, there is always tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.

Good advice.

ps - Payne Bryson also advocates  talking  to your kids about why you are using certain disciplinary techniques. Her argument is that educating kids about their own brains and responses can lead them to greater understanding and mastery over themselves. (This makes me feel better about my six year-old <a href="http://mogantosh.com/?p=269">reading parenting books</a>.)
