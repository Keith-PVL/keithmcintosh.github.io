# Homemade Lemon And Vinegar Surface Spray

## 8th December 2013

When you are trying to get kids to help with the housework,   anything that squirts from a bottle is a winner. When preschoolers get involved,   situations are unpredictable,   but Â you can be reasonably sure that at some point, your cleaning spray will make contact with an eye.

This surface spray is much kinder to an unsuspecting retina than a more complex collection of chemicals. And here's the truth - it cleans just as well. Totally fine. Vinegar is a naturally biodegradable disinfectant, and lemon essential oil is antiseptic, antimicrobial, and bactericidal.

Also, it helps to have low standards.

This is how I make mine:

Into a spray bottle, I mix:

1 cup of white vinegar

I cup of water

A little squirt of dishwashing liquid.

A few drops of lemon essential oil.

That's it. Give it a shake, and it's ready for small hands to squirt liberally onto windowsills, tabletops, onto plants, down pants...
