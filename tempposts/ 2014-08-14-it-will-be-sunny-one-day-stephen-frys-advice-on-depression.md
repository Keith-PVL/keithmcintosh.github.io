# It Will Be Sunny One Day: Stephen Fry's Advice On Depression

## 14th August 2014

Amongst all the sad reactions to the death of Robin Williams this week,   I particularly loved Terry Gilliam's words: 'Robin Williams, the most astonishingly funny, brilliant, profound and silly miracle of mind and spirit, has left the planet.  He was a giant heart, a fireball friend, a wondrous gift from the gods. Now the selfish bastards have taken him back. Fuck em!'

In a sadly prescient interview, the new Slate podcast The Gist recently talked to writer Amy Solomon about the link between comedy and mental health. You can listen to that podcast <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist/2014/08/the_gist_looks_at_the_relationship_between_comedy_and_mental_health_and.html">here</a>. Last night busy baking cakes and wrapping presents (another little one's birthday in my house today), I listened to the Mark Maron<a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/remembering_robin_williams"> interview with Williams </a>from 2010, where the two comics discuss his life, career and struggles with addiction. Williams is candid, warm and funny.

Ah, we are poorer without him.

Finally, from the lovely website <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/">Letters Of Note</a>, this advice that Stephen Fry wrote to a fan with depression. It is so apt and moving. I am committing it to memory in case I should ever need it.

Long may Stephen Fry live to bring beauty and wit to us all.

And vale, Robin Williams.
