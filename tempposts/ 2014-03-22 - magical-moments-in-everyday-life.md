I'm feeling a little under the hammer. My head is aching like a bastard, and the doctor says a sinus operation is my next move. Ay chihuahua.

It feels like a good day to remember a few funny things that have happened lately.

**1. Kids In The Boot Scare Grandpa**

Yesterday at the station I was walking back to my car when I saw an older lady standing at the boot of her car and saying 'Now just don't make any noise!' As I passed I saw two small children crammed on top of the shopping bags and umbrellas, looking very serious. The lady shut the boot, and I stopped to watch. I could see that a fine practical joke was brewing, and sure enough, soon came Grandpa, ready to pop his Pacemaker with the surprise he found waiting in his boot. Naughty Nanna.

**2. . Seniors Rock Out With Inappropriate Abandon**

I went to a Seniors Zumba class this week with my mum and my sister, and let me just say, until you have been in a room full of sweaty seniors shaking their asses to Blurred Lines - well, you have not lived.

**3. Corrupt Mumbai Call Centre Operators Are People Too**

A few days ago, I got a call from a gentleman with an Indian accent. 'Good afternoon, Madam,' he said politely, and then broke into his script. He was from Microsoft. My computer had been compromised. It was important that he walk me through a series of steps in order to make sure that the hackers had not planted any viruses in my system. Now I've been shamefully, dim-wittedly strung along by a similar outfit before, so I interrupted this guy pretty quickly. 'Yes, of course!' I said in my brightest voice. 'Shall I give you my account details immediately, or start with my credit card numbers? Or would you prefer I just read you out all my passwords, one at a time?'

There was a pause, and then, my favourite part: 'Goodbye' my caller said, in a small, polite voice, and then he hung up. The manners! The manners! This fellow had no reason to be polite when he knew I was onto his scam. It was just a human moment, between a shyster and his failed mark. I wish him well, that corrupt call-centre man. He is too good for that job.

Moments like these remind me of that research that says it is <a href="http://mogantosh.com/fall-a-little-in-love-with-everyone-you-meet-its-healthy/">healthy to fall in love with strangers.</a> I love those moments.

Keith is almost finished tinkering with his algorithms, and we soon have a date on the couch for some salt and vinegar chips and House of Cards.We are up to episode eleven which, from all accounts, is SHO-HOCKING! I can't wait.

May your Sunday be  free of worry and excessive mucous trapped in your sinus passages, and filled instead with comedic moments of charm and connection.
