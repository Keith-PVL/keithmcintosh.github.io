# Approach With Caution, No More Babies (and Here's A Giveaway)

## 14th April 2014

Look guys,   here's Katherine Hepburn; strong,   vital, glamorous.

Now picture the opposite.

Oh hai! It's me! Wreck of the Hesperus!  Sinusitis (surgery next week, bloody ell), bursitis (argh, me old-lady-hips) and period pain have combined in a perfect storm of End-Of-Termitis. I'm buggered.

It's been a long term, and on Saturday I went into Sydney for a Kidspot function - my first ever bloggers gathering. I arrived late, feeling nervous,  and ran immediately into P<a href="http://meetmeatmikes.com/">ip Lincolne. </a>

'Pip!' I blurted like a weirdo.

'Hi!' she said - ever so normal, so nice. She delivered me straight to <a href="http://gourmetgirl-friend.blogspot.com.au/">Ruth </a>and <a href="http://instagram.com/luisabrimble">Luisa</a>. I've collaborated with them both online, and I admire them hugely. They were so warm and funny. I met <a href="http://baby-mac.com/">Beth </a>too (a charismatic force of nature) and then both her and <a href="http://www.woogsworld.com/">Mrs Woog</a> were standing next to me at once and my brain couldn't psychically process my online world imploding with my real one. I murbled something along the lines of 'I carried a watermelon'.

I fell into easy conversation with <a href="http://maxabellaloves.blogspot.com.au/">Bron</a>, who was so warm and gregarious. It was a really interesting afternoon of discussion on creativity and process, and at the end, a goodie bag!

It contained, among other things, a Baby Bjorn carrier. Sadly, the K-Dog and I are done with babies (old-school readers might remember that my final pregnancy was a series of comic and tragic disasters). Until we get everybody off to school and start (we hope) to foster, there will be no more tiny people here.

So I have no use for this lovely new baby sling - the new model, which straps on the back as well as the front. Here it is, modeled by a fine looking Dad.

They're worth about $170. More details <a href="http://www.babybjorn.com.au/products/baby-carriers/baby-carrier-one-/baby-carrier-one/">here. </a> Are you pregnant? Do you have a pregnant friend? Or do you have an inordinately close relationship with your small dog? (No judgement.)

If you would like this carrier, please comment below, I'll choose a random entry and I'll post it to you.

Is this post scattered? So is my brain today. I'm about to struggle into a bra so that the little bobo's and I can hit the $2 shop for some holiday craft-material stock-ups and then we're retiring to the couch to watch Harry Potter.

Happy holidays, my friends. May you spend this week in better physical shape than I feel today, and if you ever get the chance to meet Beth, Ruth, Pip or Luisa - snap it up. They're fantastic.
