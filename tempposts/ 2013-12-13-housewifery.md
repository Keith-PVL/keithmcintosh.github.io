# housewifery

## 13th December 2013

stepehn marche and that ARTCILE ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD ALL just clean less. Quote. True?

why agree - ref slacker wife on advertising bullshit

Why that pisses me off - not just cleaning,   its organisiing, shopping, cooking laundry. Even the basics take an enormous amount of time. Whats his situation? kids?Wife?
