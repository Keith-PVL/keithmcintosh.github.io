# Three Great Interviews To Listen To While You Fold The Laundry Or Groom Your Pubis

## 5th October 2014

1. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/07/28/4055392.htm">This interview by Richard Fidler</a> with investigative journalist Kate McClymont is a cracker. McClymont recently wrote the book 'He Who Must Be Obeid',   the story of the rise and crashing fall of Eddie Obeid,   disgraced Australian politician and powerbroker.  It is a very Sydney story of corruption and power, full of 'and then **what** happened?!?!' moments, and MyClymont tells it fabulously well.  Obeid asked her to dinner once, trying, McClymont says, to bring her into his fold and convince her to stop writing damaging newspaper articles.  'Great!' she replied. 'I'll be sure to bring my food taster!'

2. This <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b048033v">Hilary Clinton interview from the BBC Woman's Hour </a>, where Clinton talks about her role shaping US foreign policy, led me to this t<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01ldnxy">his 2003 interview from the archives</a>, where she discusses Bill's infidelity and her own political ambitions. What an interesting person she is.

3. I've talked before about how much I love Lena Dunham.

Here,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/09/29/352276798/lena-dunham-on-sex-oversharing-and-writing-about-lost-girls">Terri Gross from the long-running NPR culture podcast Fresh Air talks to her</a> about her new essay collection 'Not That Kind Of Girl.'  Terri Gross often makes me laugh. She is earnest and endearingly awkward, no matter who she's talking to. Dunham is thoughtful and candid.  It's a fun listen. Happy laundry folding/washing up/amateur taxidermy session!
