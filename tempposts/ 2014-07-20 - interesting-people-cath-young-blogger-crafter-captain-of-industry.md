# Interesting People: Cath Young (Blogger, Crafter, Captain Of Industry)

## 20th July 2014

<div>

<div>

<div>In Australian craft blogging circles,   Cath Young of My Bearded Pigeon is really beloved. She epitomises the inclusive,   supportive and creative energy of Australian blogging at its best. Today,   she's talking to me about her thoughts on the evolution of the Australian blogosphere, her journey from craft hobbyist to businesswoman, her copyright battles, and the way she has combined craft and social work into her 'holy grail' of creative fulfillment.</div>

 

<div></div>

<div>Here is Cath, in fancy moving pictures, and in her own words:</div>

<div></div>

<div>**Cath when did you start blogging? Can you paint us a little picture of what the blogging landscape was like then?**</div>

<div></div>

</div>

 

<div>I started blogging in 2009 (under the name chunkychooky which was the name of my first Etsy shop. ) Marlo was 2 at the time and I was going a bit crazy at home. I had just discovered blogs, Pips (<a href="http://meetmeatmikes.com/">meetmeatmikes</a>) was the first one I read regularly and from hers I found others I loved. Blogging was so different then. Bloggers weren't on TV giving opinions and there were no sponsored posts, no one really knew the name of bloggers, it was very different. I'm not saying bloggers shouldn't  be doing those things, I'm just saying it's different now. Blogging is  a business in itself.</div>

<div></div>

 

<div>The blogs I was reading were written by women who had kids and who were crafty. I had always felt a bit isolated in my love of making things  and then I found  others who also made things via blogs and I was so inspired and excited! We would blog about what we were making and show each other, and share tutorials and there was a lot of linking between each other, there was a very strong sense of community, and lots of support amongst us crafty bloggers. None of the blogs I read had any advertising on them. I was approached by Penguin books to review craft books on my blog and I just couldn't believe they would send me books for free. I asked if I could host a giveaway with the review and that worked really well, but not long after that I stated getting approached for other types of reviews and I remember struggling with it... Was it Ok ? What were these companies? Were they ethical, etc...?  My business took off at about the same time and I got busy and then another baby and,  well,  blogging was on the back burner for a bit.</div>

 

<div>

<div></div>

<div>**Were you always crafty? When did your crafting begin to shift from a hobby to a business?**</div>

<div></div>

</div>

 

<div>Yep. Reading books and making things were my favourite things as a kid and they are STILL my favourite things. (And as much as I spend time reminding myself that Marlo is not a mini me and may not enjoy the same things as me,  she does!! ) I was always making things. Always.</div>

<div></div>

 

<div>I started making things to sell- starting with fisherman pants for babies and toddlers and then toys, under the name chunkychooky when I was on maternity leave. I started <a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/mybeardedpigeon">My Bearded Pigeon</a> in 2011 and within about 3 months it went from little hobby to full time business. It was a very steep learning curve. I never would have thought I could run my own business but I love being my own boss, I love working in my pyjamas.</div>

 

<div>

<div></div>

<div>**Is it a never-rains-but-it-pours sort of situation when you are selling your work online? How do you juggle the up-and-down nature of crafting as a business? Has it ever totally fallen apart?**</div>

<div></div>

</div>

 

<div>I freak out - still- if a day goes by without a sale. This is quite ridiculous and ludicrous but I can't help it. I try to be all zen about it but I can't be. It's MONEY. It's serious. It's helping our family pay bills and work less away from home. It totally fell apart - rather I totally fell apart- when I reopened the business when Romi was 3 weeks old. November is our business month of the year, and when I say that I mean our orders triple, so I couldn't keep the shop closed- and yeah well, 3 week old baby and running a business. I cried a lot. Romi was attached to me the whole time and just slept but I was rather hysterical.</div>

 

<div></div>

<div>I try to, when the business is quiet, work on new products but it's time consuming and I get interrupted a lot! I also work as a Drug and Alcohol counsellor (I'm a social worker ) 2 days a week for the Department of Health and yes, it's as full on as it sounds and yes, craft is my outlet, but I couldn't imagine doing the crafty stuff without the social worky stuff as well.  I like doing both .</div>

<div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div>**What are you interested in making at the minute? What is catching your eye and inspiring you right now?**</div>

<div></div>

<br />

</div>

<div>I am looking into some new ideas and maybe even some design related study later in the year if my brain is up to it! What's catching my eye at the moment- same ol same ol- photography. I have been doing a 52 project via Jodi at <a href="http://www.practisingsimplicity.com/">Practicing Simplicity</a> and have had my camera on manual all year. I have learnt so much by forcing myself to use my DSLR every week. I spend a lot of time looking at photography and working out what I like about the photos. What's catching my eye is how boring a lot of styling is  - same chairs! I love Eames but so many magazines,  year after year..... It all just looks the same, replica chairs and IKEA furniture, I'm finding some interesting stuff from overseas and it's great. I do love Pinterest for this reason. So maybe I am noticing what's annoying me as much as what's inspiring me.</div>

<div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div>**What advice would you give to somebody hoping to sell their craft or art online?**</div>

</div>

 

Don't copy. Seriously. Just don't. Don't open a shop with stuff you saw on Etsy and think no one will notice. If you start selling an item that was originally on a large international blog as a tutorial you cannot claim it as your own. Don't pay for information about opening a shop online until you have read all the free stuff that is available.

<div>Spend time on things  like a good logo and branding and a good name. Don't call it (insert name here) creations, you are creative,  so be creative with your name. Handmade with love is also taken, a million times over.</div>

<div>

<br />

<div></div>

<div>**Can you tell us a little about some of your copyright struggles?**</div>

<div></div>

</div>

 

<div>I could write pages about the pain of copyright and my hangry cushion. It has been very stressful at times. I would love to start a crafty/ arty/ designer union for help with this, but the big thing I learnt is you don't always need a lawyer. There is lots of tips and help online and some basic principles that you need to know.</div>

<div></div>

 

<div>Have a look here: <a href="http://www.copyright.org.au/" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.<wbr />org.au</a></div>

 

<div></div>

<div>People will tell you all kinds of crap like "if they change 10% it's not copying". That's not true. There are so many myths. You also need to grasp the Berne Convention on copyright across the world. (Here is a simple explanation: <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention" target="_blank">http://en.m.<wbr />wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_<wbr />Convention</a>).  You do not need to register copyright in Australia but you need to be able to prove dates. A blog post or Etsy sale will do that.</div>

<div></div>

 

<div>I managed to negotiate a large settlement for myself when a big company that put my hangry design word for word on a t-shirt. The most important thing is this: DO NOT NAME AND SHAME. You may need this as bargaining power later, but also you can be sued for defamation down the track. People will tell you to name them, DONT! ( And just for the record, I'm not claiming to have invented the word Hangry, but the definition I use on my items, which is subject to copyright since 2011 is my very own definition that I made up and the concept of putting the word hangry in dictionary form on an item is also my concept.)</div>

<div>**What is Days for Girls and how can people get involved?**</div>

</div>

 

</div>

<div></div>

<div>I can't believe I hadn't heard of DfG until a few months ago. Now something  I live and breathe! Days for Girls is a worldwide organisation with a goal of providing women and girls across the world with feminine hygiene kits- sewn reusable pads, a washcloth etc so they do not have to miss days of school or work when they have their period because girls have access to NOTHING! Girls are using  chicken feathers and corn husks or sitting on pieces of cardboard at home or piles of ash , for days,  EVERY MONTH.</div>

<div></div>

 

<div>When I first heard about it, like every person I have told, I actually felt ashamed that I had never thought about what women in other parts of the world use when they have their period. We now have a Bellingen group and we have had lots of interest.  The CWA is sewing some kits and a group of high school students learning to sew after school are also joining. We will be sending our first lot of kits to Papua New Guinea in a shipping container full of medical supplies. We are changing girls lives and it is the most awesome thing. It's Craft and social work combined- it's the holy grail for me! If you would like to be involved please like our page Days for girls Bellingen on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dfgbellingen">Here's the link</a>.)</div>

Thanks Cath! Find more from Cath (and that Hangry cushion) at her <a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/mybeardedpigeon">Etsy shop</a> and  her <a href="http://www.mybeardedpigeon.com/">blog</a>
