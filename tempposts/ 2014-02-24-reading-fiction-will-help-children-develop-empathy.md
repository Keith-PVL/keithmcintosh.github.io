# Reading Fiction Will Help Children Develop Empathy

## 24th February 2014

Pudding stretches for books just beyond her reach. I hope she continues that way.

Last year there was a<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/"> research finding</a> that generated a bit of buzz. It said that reading fiction to children helped them to detect and understand the emotions of others.

The research stressed that 'good' literary fiction was critical:  'writerly' rather than 'popular' books. The authors held that books that focused on characters and their relationships encouraged the reader to imagine a characters internal thoughts and struggles,   while 'genre fiction' (the study used Danielle Steele as an example) encouraged an emotional response, and aimed mainly to provide an exciting experience.

The methodology of the study has been questioned (Danielle Steele is pretty big on relationships, no?) but the idea itself  rings beautifully true to me.

I explored the power of reading once before, when writing about what it meant to be the mother of a son.

<blockquote>

I am told that the day will come when my barnacle boy will no longer beg me for cuddles (cue the sound of my breaking heart).  Apparently when boys reach a certain age they lose the ability to speak, and you are forced to interpret grunts and facial twitches in lieu of actual conversation.  For years now, I have been building a massive weaponry against this adolescent wall o’silence. It’s called the bookshelf. My teenager's collection, which grows with every school fete and Salvos visit, covers the spectrum from Judy Blume to Puberty Blues to The Outsiders to Bukowski to Nick Hornby.

<br>



I hope that opening up many worlds to my boy will help him to understand the lives of others, and to give flight to his dreams. I hope that in tough times, when he feels he cannot share his worries with anybody, that books will help him to feel less alone. I also hope that the wide sea of relationships he can explore in books will give him a more realistic picture of sex than the images he is likely - heartbreakingly likely -  to see on the internet.

<br>

I take the job of supplying this alternative narrative of sex and relationships through fiction very seriously. It’s not like I anticipate easy conversations on the topic with thirteen year old T-Bone. ‘Sit down, darling. It’s time for Mummy to talk you through the layered gender politics of lady-bush.’ Um, no. Yet, I think the grip that the porn industry has on the net is viciously strong, and the messages it sends to young people are false and damaging. I don’t want to be creepy with my kids, but I am not afraid to let The Joy Of Sex (original Euromuff edition) be creepy for me.   

<br>

Of course, I hope T-Bones’s instinct will not be to eschew reading altogether. I imagine, in fact, that this might be a pretty sweet rebellion against his nerdily eager, bookish mother. (Note to self: be cool. Be cool!)

</blockquote>

I want my kids to explore many ways to live, to think, to have fun,  to make sense of their lives.  I especially want them to be compassionate and kind people, and expanding their internal universes to encompass as many stories as possible seems a good way to start. (Plus  they can stay nice and safe on the couch with a cardigan on as they roam wide and wild. Win win!)

Keith and I have read out loud to the children for years. (Keith even more than me.) At the minute, the big kids and I are loving My Side Of the Mountain, a 50's classic about a kid who runs away to live alone in the woods. In the past, we've enjoyed  Black Beauty, White Boots, Charlotte's Web, A Wrinkle In Time, Roald Dahl's whole canon, the Little House on The Prairie series, Harry Potter, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,  and many more, lost to memory. We read out loud in phases. Sometimes life gets too busy. Sometimes we're in a cards phase. Sometimes we are just out of juice.

But those reading times are some of our sweetest, most peaceful moments.When I am on the couch with two quiet children listening as I read aloud, and I know that in their silence they are creating pictures and asking and answering their own internal questions about the story, I feel so happy. It feels like a whole different kind of nurturing to me, a feeding of the brain and the spirit.

Do you read to your kids? Have they loved any particular book? Let me know, so I can put it on my list.
