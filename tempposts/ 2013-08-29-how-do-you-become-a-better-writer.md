# How Do You Become A Better Writer?

## 29th August 2013

There's something about Sylvia's arms in this shot that give the impression she's snapping a 50's selfie,   don't you think? No duckface though.

Before winter,   I had gotten in the habit of getting  up very early in the morning to write 500 words in the quiet before the family wakes and my proper, noisy, busy day begins. This 'book' I am working on is a shambolic, unreadable patchwork of half-arsed thoughts and halting language and dumb descriptions. I am plugging doggedly forward  however, throwing my inner critic to the wall, because my aim is just to finish a first draft, no matter how painful and embarrassing it seems.  When I begin to edit and refine a second draft, that is where I will turn on my critical gaze. During this first draft, I am focusing only on words-on-the-page.

This early morning discipline has disappeared over the winter, but as the spring appears, and my lingering sickness fades, I am reinstating the habit.

I am fascinated by the process of writing. I love to explore how people do it, so  <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-does-one-become-a-better-writer?__pmsg__=+MmxJRmV3RFFXS2RQRGdKOWtkWVA6YS5hcHAudmlldy5wbXNnLmFsbC5Mb2dnZWRJbkZyb21MaW5rOltbMTAxMjQ5MzNdLCB7fV0*%20this%20Quora%20thing%20is%20awesome.%20Ivy:%20Goodbye%20my%20friend,%20My%20love%20will%20never%20end.">this Quora post</a> appealed to me.

The first answer:

<ul>

<li>Read often;</li>

<li>Write daily;</li>

<li>Seek feedback (preferably from more experienced writers);</li>

<li>Abandon ego;</li>

<li>Proofread everything;</li>

<li>Observe the world;</li>

<li>Take notes constantly;</li>

<li>Emulate your favorite writers;</li>

<li>Revise, revise, revise; and</li>

<li>Embrace structure.</li>

</ul>

It goes on to outline reading lists, writing exercises and other advice. All good stuff.

<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2013/daily_rituals/daily_rituals_life_hacking_tips_from_novelists_painters_and_filmmakers.html">This wonderful Slate series</a> of articles examines the daily life of writers. Something of a nutty and compulsive bunch, on the whole. Sylvia Plath wrote in the hours between her sleeping pills wearing off and the children waking up, Balzac drank up to 50 cups of coffee a day, Auden took Benzedrine 'like a daily multivitamin' for twenty years, and many writers took four-hour naps or walks  in the afternoon.

I think I relate most to Edgar Allen Poe who said '"I am excessively slothful, and wonderfully industrious—by fits."
