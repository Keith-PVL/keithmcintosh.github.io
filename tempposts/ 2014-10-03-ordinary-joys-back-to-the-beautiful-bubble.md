# Ordinary Joys (Back To The Beautiful Bubble)

## 3rd October 2014

I sometimes feel an oppressive sense of impending doom hovering above.  Do you feel it? A chill in the air,   a whispering of some imminent trouble. Big trouble. Final,   unspeakable trouble.

I feel it around ISIS, around Putin, around Gaza, around climate change. Around the local as well as the global.

At the same time, I feel intense happiness within my little world. My family, my friends, my house. My little place in blogland.  My outrageous funny children.  The solid footing of my relationship with Keith. The slide into middle age.

Sometimes Keith and I talk about what's happening in the World, with it's worrying, seemingly inexplicable problems that are beyond our scope to solve or even to understand. And then we say to each other 'Ah well. Back to the bubble.'

The beautiful bubble.  Listening to kids debating the rules of Monopoly. Reading Game Of Thrones in the bath. Folding the washing and listening to the BBC Woman's Hour. Brewing coffee and tossing salad and applying Band-Aids and tucking clean sheets onto the bed. Trying (and failing) to stop the littlest child from shouting 'Have a good penis!' as she waves Dad off to work.

I feel very lucky to have the safe haven of these everyday, mundane pleasures. All these small joys are  made perhaps even more poignant and sweet by the modern anxiety that counters them- are we approaching the end of the world as we know it? Are we, really?

Maybe.

Maybe not.

I like this poem by William Martin:
