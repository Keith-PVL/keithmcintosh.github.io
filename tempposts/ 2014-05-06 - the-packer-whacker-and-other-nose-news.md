# The Packer-Whacker And Other Nose News

## 6th May 2014

So both James Packer and are spending today  feeling like we've been punched in the nose.

Did you catch the news? I mean soap opera? I mean Greek tragedy? I mean frat-house comedy? I must admit I found the sordid tale delightful.  It's so... egalitarian. So bloody Australian.  Two rich fat-cat bastards punching on in the street,   red-faced, sunglasses falling off, ruining their trackie dacks.

It reminded me of the classic middle-aged man fight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant in Bridget Jones' diary. 'Fight! Fight! It's a REAL FIGHT!'

Comedy aside, I hope even a tiny stink of this ridiculous barney will stick, and in some way have a negative impact on Packer's gambling empire.

I'm especially sensitive to nose-news at the minute. I am on the improve every day, but still feeling very tender and sore, although Keith's life has improved now that I am no longer snoring like a alcoholic hammer-thrower.  (He's back at work now too, and sad that little Pudding has stopped calling him Daddymother.)

Yesterday I got back on the horse o'life;  out and about on my own for the first time, driving, doing the school drop-off and the food shopping while Mum took the little one.  (Thanks so much Nanna.)

I was pretty buggered. T-Bone's  version of 'helping Mummy' was getting out of the car, lying down on the footpath outside school and refusing to move. I tried to pull him up as leftover water from my nasal rinsing streamed down my sleeve. (Classy!)

'Please T, ' I begged him hopelessly. 'That's one! **Please** T. That's two!' Luckily my friend Jen came along and hauled him into school. She also looked after the little one yesterday **and** made us dinner, **and **I am almost positive she's not waiting outside my house now to punch me in the nose.

Choose your friends more carefully Jamie!

Also, stop augmenting your fortune through the miseries of others.
