# Off The Clock: A Mother's Escape

## 19th January 2014

Yesterday I left all three children in the care of their father and took off to do the back-to-school shopping. On my own. On. My. Own. On me own for gaws sake!

It was a party. Witness Figure 1 below: my elegant lunch spread in the central Wollongong food court. Chicken laksa,   a can of the illicit black doctor,   and a Time magazine from the remainder bin at the newsagency.  Could I have managed any of these elements with my three children present? I think we all know the answer to that pitiful question.

Also, I didn't have to stave off anybody's blood-sugar meltdown with a box of sultanas, detour to the toilet after an  unexpected bout of incontinence, or shoulder a giant bag containing  the solutions to any number of random possible occurrences.

My list was lengthy and involved. School clothes, car fuses, medical strapping tape, lamb chops, electric toothbrush heads, typewriter ribbon, etc. Such are the eclectic shopping needs of a family of five. But was I daunted? Was I nay!  I had a car, a plan, and a full afternoon, which I used with care and precision. (See food court, above.) I was alooooooooooooooone!  ** **

****Twice, teenage sales girls said I was just like their mother, with exactly the same tone of kind condescension I would have used at their age. Here I am, I realised,  with my grey hairs, my reading glasses, my air of slight confusion.

Here I am, a middle-aged woman.

At the the supermarket,  I embraced it. Whoever is spinning the tracks at BiLo has their finger on the cultural pulse, dammit, and they served me up a easy-listening festival of glory. I danced a little as I threw the fish fingers  in my trolley, and I really felt that I still, as the young people, say,  'had it'. On the way home, I stopped at the beach, wriggled out of my gear - nip-slips be damned! who looks at middle-aged women anyway? - and into my new swimming costume (on sale at Best and Less, $24.95). Diving under the waves, I felt strong, alive and happy.

It was a great afternoon. I  was reminded <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/11/life_is_a_series_of_deadlines_for_the_first_time_in_15_years_i_got_off_the.2.html">of this piece</a> from Slate's Hanna Rosin, who wrote about the fact that as a mother, you become attuned to the rhythm of others. Sometimes you don't even notice how much, until you exit from it for a while.

<blockquote>What does it feel like to set your own rhythm? As a parent this is the first thing you forget. The free gift that comes with your infant is a clock implanted in your brain that briskly divides your day into short shifts. This begins almost immediately when you are forced onto the graveyard shift without much preparation or training. Soon you are promoted to day but learn to pay close attention to the silent alarms: wake, eat, nap, play, eat, nap, play, sleep. Even though long formless expanses of time were once the norm, you do not mind the new discipline; in fact some days your sanity depends on you and your underling sticking to the deadlines.</blockquote>

Every once in a while, it's so good to get off the clock. Even if it's just to buy All-Bran and undies.
