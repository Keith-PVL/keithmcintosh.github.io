# Nerd Genetics and Game Night

## 18th February 2014

It's just a matter of time before I am outsmarted,   outwitted and out-outmaneuvered by the game-meisters in this house. Keith,   I have realised, has a secret plan to raise the children to be evil, strategic game nerds. Recently, he took his plan to a new level when he taught Peanut and T-Bone how to make an Excel spreadsheet of their Monopoly moves so they could understand the game statistically, and strategise accordingly.

I am not even kidding. I've seen it. It's complicated. With colour-coded graphs.  The kids had a great time entering all the data, Keith said. 'Was it...funny...? I asked. I could only understand the whole enterprise as a sort of absurdist comedy exercise. 'No, ' Keith said. 'It was just excellent fun.'

We're big on games. Right now Keith is teaching the kids 500, adding rules but by bit, and we are loving playing that. Uno, of course, and Battleship, other classic board games, dice games, card games. A French racing game called Milles Bornes from Keith's childhood is very popular.  When Grandpa is here, we always play Milles Bornes, and he and the kids form a team they call The League, playing against Keith and I (known as the Common Enemy.)  Grandpa has even taught the kids his old war cry from Armidale High in the 50's. Last time we played, they did their war cry, then thrashed us, and then Peanut drew a picture. "Here, Mummy, this is you and Daddy being struck by lightning.'

Competitive much?

Me, I'm not so good. I spend time confused, with my mouth open, confusing Spades with Clubs. I will be left behind quite soon. But every once in a while, I think I will finally beat Keith. T-Bone got Monopoly last Christmas, and I was sure it was time for my moment in the sun.

'I'm gonna smash you, ' I crowed. I high-fived the excited children. "Daddy's going down!' I shouted.

In a shamefully short period of time, I realised, once again,that I had badly underestimated just how nerdy my husband was. It was clear that Keith didn't only know the price of every street from memory, but also how much that price altered as you added houses and hotels. Sadly, I asked him what other Monopoly strategy he had.

'Well, you should  take into consideration that Chance and Community Chest can only send people to Pall Mall, Trafalgar Square, Old Kent Road and Mayfair, ' he said thoughtfully. ' Excepting that ''go back three squares' can put you on Vine St and a couple of others. Also, there's a one in 6 chance that somebody will roll a seven, which is the highest probability, but you need also to consider that because you can get another turn on a double, that it skews the likelihood of whether somebody will land on you, on certain numbers, on certain spaces.'

He was getting more enthusiastic by the minute.

'And then there's the return on investment, and on which occasion it is statistically preferable to build houses, considering that one of the worst returns is when you have to sell houses, which is a much poorer deal than mortgaging. Sometimes its preferable to be in jail, and sometimes its worth paying the fifty dollars to get out quick.'

He was standing now, gesticulating.

'And in some scenarios it's advantageous to auction. And, also...'

I stopped him. For his own good.

Recently Keith's uncle Rob sent us a photo of a letter in the Melbourne Library collection, written about Keith grandfather Gaius, who was a chess master.

The devil himself.

And now, with three little protegees...
