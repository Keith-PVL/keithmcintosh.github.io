# Concerned that I Have Entered A Tricky New Meta Phase of Parenting

## 11th September 2013

Last night at the dinner table,   six year old Peanut said to me 'Mum, if a kid is yelling a lot and everything out of a little scratch, just don't make a big deal of it. '

'What?' I said.

'You know when you have a scratch and it's not blood or anything but maybe just a white line, you know those white lines you get on your arm? Just don't get, too, all big deal, 'oh, are you all right? Oh, don't worry, little kid' about it."

I tried to catch the thread of logic but it eluded me like smoke, as so often happens in conversation with my kids.

'Do you mean don't pay too much attention to when you guys hurt themselves?'

'Yep', Ivy said. 'Just get out. Save yourself.'

Did you get this from somewhere, Ivy?' I asked.

'Political Parents or something,' she said.

I remembered that she had picked up a parenting book in the bathroom yesterdaycalled Politically Incorrect Parenting, and setled in on the lounge with it.

<p The six year-old reading the parenting books. This is uncharted waters. I may be in some trouble.
