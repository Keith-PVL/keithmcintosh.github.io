## 3rd December 2013

My new thingy!

The picture is a little dark,   but this cabinet was forty bucks at the op shop. It's now housing the games, the random precious things, the place-mats, our beloved eagle lamp and the K-Dog's house-plants, which have spent years migrating about with no permanent home.

Interiors happiness! Meanwhile, the girls keep arranging knick-knacks. They have caught the magpie nesting gene, it seems.
