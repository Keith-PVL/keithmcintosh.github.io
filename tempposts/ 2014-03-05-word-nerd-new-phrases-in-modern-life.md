# Word Nerd: New Phrases in Modern Life

## 5th March 2014

Here are three interesting terms I've come across in my travels lately:

1. **Unicorn**: the single person who agrees to be the 'playmate' for a polyamorous  couple. A good 'unicorn' is in high demand,   they say. In the 'biz'.

2. **Picker**: the person in a warehouse that runs around finding and filling all the items to be posted. A growth industry,   and a fascinating,   tough job:  <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/brown-box/">listen here</a> to a picker's tale.

3. **White-Hat Hacker** - a computer hacker who works for the government. (Makes me think of that old gag: 'I'm a bigot - but for the left.')

And now, go forth and use them all in a sentence!
