# The Eggplants Are Stuffed, The Chaos Glitters

## 2nd June 2014

This week my copy of <a href="http://www.alphabetfamilyjournal.com/">Alphabet Family Journal</a> arrived in the mail. This new Australian magazine celebrates domestic life with gorgeous photography and personal essays. The makers say:

<blockquote>We believe that families are the sum of their everyday triumphs and trials. We believe the home is a lived space and not a showroom. We believe there is a need for families to slow down and return to basics,   like curiosity,   collaboration and storytelling.</blockquote>

It's a collaborative triumph, this journal, coming together via a Kickstarter campaign and the hard work of Luisa Brimble and her team. (If you enjoy photography, you should follow <a href="http://instagram.com/luisabrimble">Luisa on Instagram</a>; her eye is lovely.) This first edition feature pieces that all start with the letter 'A', and I contributed an essay called 'Attention' that still rings true  and real for me as a assessment of our family life. I'm reproducing it here below, and you can buy the first edition of Alphabet Family Journal <a href="http://www.alphabetfamilyjournal.com/">here</a>.

<blockquote>My 4 year old son T-Bone and I had this conversation recently. ‘T, the bathroom smells a lot like wee. Have you been weeing on the walls?’ He answered carefully.  ‘I used to do that Mummy, but not anymore.’  Calm, I thought to myself. Patience.  I breathed deeply and then regretted it. The place smelled like the baboon enclosure at a sub-par zoo. 'When did you stop doing that, T?’ I asked. ‘Just right now,’ he said. It’s clear that T-Bones grasp on bathroom etiquette needs attention. The problem is, so does everything else in my life.

It’s the conundrum of motherhood. How do I meet the attention needs of three children, one husband, a part-time job, the housework, two parents, some in-laws, friends, schools, a pre-school, a day-care and an inner self?

Like most women, I have two eyeballs (plus the one in the back of my head that switches on when the baby is in the pantry drinking food colouring) and each kid wants those eyeballs on them, all the time. Mount Washmore is overflowing. The garden is a jungle. The car is in the early stages of composting itself. The baby has squashed banana into the cutlery drawer and the 6 year old has poured glitter onto every surface of the house.

In the midst of it all is the kitchen, effectively the middle child of the house, producing spectacular performances and requiring the most attention.  I am a terrible housekeeper, but a good cook, better at stuffing an eggplant that sweeping a dust bunny. I love being in the kitchen, but still, it’s intense: one meal ends, the clean-up begins, and it’s time to start on the next.

As for me, I need to switch off and turn my attention to The Real Housewives of New York sometimes. I need to lie in the bath and read memoirs about Provence and the New Yorker magazine. I need to decant my chattering mind onto my blog or enter the social media universe for a few minutes at a time. I need to do yoga and I need to hang out with my darling husband and I need to have coffee with my girlfriends every once in a while (as in, actual human interaction rather than ticking over on the holding pattern of ‘liking’ Facebook statuses and shouting ‘nice scarf!’ at the school drop-off.)

In the end, what sucks most of my attention is the future, which is constantly intruding on the present. There are bags to pack, appointments to book, shoes to find, medication to administer. Plus, it is a law of physics* that as soon as you turn the full force of your attention on one child, another will have some sort of obscene poo emergency.

It is a challenge for me to ignore that ‘next need’, to stay with the present moment, to allow the to-do lists to recede and to focus my attention on the child, the eggplant,  or the man in front of me*. My challenge is to resist the insistent pull of forward-motion. To slow, and to stop in the now. This moment, this beautiful moment, in which we are alive and happy, and our walls smell like wee, and our eggplants are stuffed, and our chaos glitters.

<h5>*This is a lie</h5>

<h5>**Hopefully my husband and not the barista, because that would make him remember me as ‘Creepy Intense Latte Lady’ rather than ‘Lady Who Ties Hair Back With Pair Of Underpants’.</h5>

Happy weekending everybody! I'm off to dinner with some of my oldest girlfriends, excited to watch T-Bone play in his first rugby game, and looking forward to some good down-time watching Borgen with the K Dog.
