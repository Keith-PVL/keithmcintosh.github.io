# The Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Kids do

## 25th March 2015

Computer scientist Gever Tully founded the Tinkering School,   a sort of summer-camp-nirvana for kids,   where they can  'extend the boundaries of their safety zones'. At the Tinkering School, kids build whatever they can think of - using power tools, if they like.

Tully describes it thus:

<blockquote>In their wonderful book 'The Body Has a Mind of It’s Own', Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee describe some of the amazing science behind how, when we pick up a stick or a tool, our minds extend our sense of “self” out to the end of that stick. We can “touch” things with the stick and get a very accurate “feel” for the object we are “touching”. So, it stands to reason that a power tool is just a very dangerous stick and we can learn feel through it as well — we just need the safe context in which to learn how to mitigate the risks the power tool presents. These risks are both real and imagined in many cases and part of the learning process includes dispelling the imaginary risks by developing skill through practice.</blockquote>

Let the kids play with fire, Tully says. Also, own a pocket-knife, throw a spear, and deconstruct appliances to find out how they work.

Here's Tully's full Ted talk:

I really like this.

I like Tully's 'lean out' vibe.

There is a growing body of research that supports the idea of children playing away from adult supervision, especially in a natural setting, and there is also some fascinating evidence that autonomy from adults can result in enhanced frontal or ‘executive functioning’ systems for children. One study found that kids who played with other kids in the absence of adults had about one year’s greater development of higher-brain function, improving their scores on measures like inhibition, problem solving and decision making, and even having an impact on lower drug and alcohol use in teenage years. Other studies have found an ‘inoculation effect’ from risky play like handling dangerous tools, exploring and wrestling. This effect can mean that children who play more risky games as kids are less anxious as adults.

There is also recent research supporting the benefits of ‘opting out’ of involvement with school and homework, so as to allow kids to ‘learn how to fail’ early, when the stakes are lower. Finally, and critically, research findings on empathy (or the understanding of ‘life as lived by other people’) hold that play dates where adults are quick to step in and solve problems, can prevent children from figuring out how to negotiate, trouble-shoot and manage relationships for themselves. In adulthood, this can have profound implications.

It's all a process of taking the eyes of Big Mother off everything the kids do.

Harder than it should be, really.

I don't know that I will arrive at school pick-up today juggling two roaring chainsaws and shouting 'Darlings! Mummy has a marvellous new parenting technique! for you!' But I might pick up a broken gadget from the op shop and set it up with some little screws for after school fun. Also, send them off to Kid Land in the bush across the road.
