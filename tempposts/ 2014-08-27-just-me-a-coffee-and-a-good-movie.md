# Just Me, A Coffee and A Good Movie

## 27th August 2014

This morning I felt pretty ordinary. The old back has been troubling me for a couple of days,   and my creeping sinus infection has stepped up a notch. Inspired by <a href="http://baby-mac.com/">Beth</a>,   I took Â the day off and played hooky from normal life. I went to the movies and saw the most beautiful film: the 100 Foot Journey. It had everything: romance, food, the French countryside. A perfect film - and because I watched it at 10am with all the seniors, the cinema even provided bickies to go with my takeaway coffee!

I could not have been happier. Afterwards I wandered the shops a little and bought a couple of new tops that said 'springtime in Provence' to me.

It was a good day. Good for the spirit. I sometimes need to make myself press 'pause' on the constant motion of family life, the endless mental planning that runs like a soundtrack through my brain. Must do this, and then this - pick this up, shop for that, cook this, buy that, book the other, don't forget! don't forget!don't forget!

Lovely to take a little time-out. Let's call it day-release from the madness of motherhood.
