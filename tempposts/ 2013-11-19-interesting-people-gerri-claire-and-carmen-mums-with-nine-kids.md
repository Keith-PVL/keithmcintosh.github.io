# Interesting People: Gerri, Claire and Carmen (Mums with Nine Kids!)

## 19th Whoops 2013

I interviewed three mums with large families for <a href="http://mamabake.com/">Mamabake </a>recently. It was fascinating to delve into the everyday details of how families with a lot of children manage domestic life. Gerri,   Claire and Carmen were fabulous and they spilled all about school lunches,   big-batch cooking,   house-cleaning and managing stress.

Their life stories are different, but all three shared a sense of humour and keen organisational skills. You'd have to, wouldn't you?

You can <a href="http://mamabake.com/2013/11/14/life-with-nine-children-the-lowdown-from-three-mums-who-know/">read more here</a>Â about these three mums, if you'd like.
