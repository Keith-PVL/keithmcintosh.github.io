Perhaps you'll start your day like <a href="http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/floyd-mayweathers-morning-ritual-is-absurd/story-fno61i58-1227017751447">Floyd Mayweather</a>, who liked to be surrounded by nubile ladies who announced 'The morning penis is clean'? Except, I don't have a penis and I doubt I would hire a housekeeper to clean it if I did. I'd much rather they spent their time folding the washing. That would be fantastic.

I'm inclined to sstart the day like James Boswell in 1763, who advised:

'As soon as you have huddled on your clothes, open your chamber window and throw your head out, keeping your mouth wide open in order to feast upon the fresh air.  In this posture remain for near the space of a quarter of an hour. Then proceed to bodily exercise by dancing and capering about your room for near twenty-five minutes.'

It is very, very hard to go past the workl of Rogerant Tshibangu.

AI think a combination of all systens is called for today.

Happy Monday my friends. May your week be wonderful.
