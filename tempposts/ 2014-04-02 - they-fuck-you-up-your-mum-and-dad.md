# They Fuck You Up, Your Mum And Dad

## 2nd April 2014

I'm working on a piece of writing,   and thinking a lot about parenting. We're all just flailing around trying to figure it all out,   aren't we? Failures, successes, swings and roundabouts. Family life is a beautiful mess that creates itself on the fly.

Over and over, the poem This Be The Verse by Philip Larkin keeps repeating in my head this morning:

They fuck you up, your mum and dad.

They may not mean to, but they do.

They fill you with the faults they had

And add some extra, just for you.

 

But they were fucked up in their turn

By fools in old-style hats and coats,

Who half the time were soppy-stern

And half at one another’s throats.

 

Man hands on misery to man.

It deepens like a coastal shelf.

Get out as early as you can,

And don’t have any kids yourself.

God, it makes me laugh. Like Homer Simpson says "It's funny because it's true.'  Universally so.

ps - This one goes out with love and gratitude to Nanna and Pop. Bless your cotton socks. You did your best! Anything good I manage as a mum I owe to you. All the flaws; well, let's blame them on the boogie.
