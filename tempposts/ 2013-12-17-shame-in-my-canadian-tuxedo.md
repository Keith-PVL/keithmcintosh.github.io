# Shame In My Canadian Tuxedo

## 17th December 2013

Yesterday,   picking up seven year old Peanut from a play date,   the toddler bit a chunk from a piece of glass and made her lip bleed. While we were dealing with it,   5 year-old T-Bone came over, and pulled at my shirt.

Unfortunately, the shirt was chambray, with press studs, not buttons, and T-Bones enthusiasm caused it to open with a flourish - pop! pop! pop! - exposing my whole front section to a school dad.

Just another day in the office.

Unrelated, but hilarious; this 'missed connections' <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/you-farted-in-trader-joes-m4w">ad from Craigslist:</a>

<blockquote>'You were the tall brunette with the near perfect body that farted in the bread section last night. I was the tall guy next to you that looked over and asked, "Was that you?" You quickly replied "No ... Wasn't me!" You almost seemed insulted I would ask. As the stink grew you continued to deny your flatulence, but it was evident. I tried to get rid of the stench by waving 2 loafs of ciabatta bread. You proceeded to storm off in an angry manner. You are beautiful and even if you are a liar and fart like a Clydesdale, I'd love to meet up sometime!'</blockquote>
