# White Couches, Repressed Rage and Precious Firstborn Syndrome

## 22nd October 2014

 

I'm feeling slightly frazzled and stressed this morning. I've got that sickish feeling that my stomach lining is eating itself,   and I feel sad and sorry about all the irritable stomping about I did while trying to get the kids off to school. Fail,   fail, fail.

A late night at the P and C with all three kids (Keith's away, and I had to go talk about a thing) rolled into the crazy fun of playing Stagger Up And Down The Hallway in the wee hours dealing with wet beds and lost blankets and bad dreams. I woke up squashed in the middle of two littles poking each other and shouting 'HE TOUCHED ME!!'

In my defense, I did  most of the shouting inside my own head. I've been thinking, in fact, that if Science just figured out how to tap into the energy that is the bottled and repressed rage of parents trying to get their kids to school in the morning, we'd be onto the greatest renewable resource in history.

The Tumblr 'It's Like They Know Us' is the funniest thing on raising kids I've seen lately.

<p "You think **I’M** being unfair? You want to wear saturated primary colors? BE MY GUEST. But I will not stand by and let you disparage the muted principles your mother and I worked so hard to teach you.”</p>

<p "Life moves awful fast nowadays, but we always find time to cuddle awkwardly on the floor in a plain white room. It helps keep us connected"</p>

<p "Brushing my toddler’s teeth is my favorite way to unwind. She never flops around like a deranged mackerel hell-bent on knocking herself unconscious on the nearest wall, counter, or tile floor. It’s our special time together."</p>

<p "And in this one, you were juuuust crowning."</p>

Guilty as charged! Definitely.</p>

<p Keep on trucking, Mumz and Dadz. We'll just figure this shit out as we roll along.</p>
