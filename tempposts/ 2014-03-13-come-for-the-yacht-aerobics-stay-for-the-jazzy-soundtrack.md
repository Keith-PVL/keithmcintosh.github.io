# Come for the Yacht Aerobics Stay for the Jazzy Soundtrack

## 13th March 2014

Just.

Because.

Where is Jaclyn Zeman now?

In this clip,   Lady J is definitely favouring that right leg, bending it back and forward, up and down, in and out.  I don't blame her -  if I had done such a damn fine job trimming my downstair hedges I may too have wanted to display my work, like an extroverted, hyper-flexible, water-loving baboon.

But I fear that if Jaclyn kept favouring one leg over the other she is now lurching about the place; a lady in her autumn years with one massive muscled thigh and one small wizened twig-leg.  Turning in circles, forever and ever. Extremely dangerous on a yacht.
