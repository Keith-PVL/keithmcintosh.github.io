# I Left My Heart in Tarraleah Wait, No I Mean My Husbands' Underpants

## 1st December 2014

<h5 **Disclosure: The family spent the weekend as guests of Tarraleah,   but all opinions are my own.**</h5>

In the central highlands of Tasmanian; halfway between Hobart and the wilder west coast draws of Strahan and the Franklin River,   there is a little town called Tarraleah. We stayed there this weekend so I could attend a Christmas cooking course at their Wildside Cooking School (more on this tomorrow.)

<p Tarraleah was a bustling hydro-electric village in the 20's and 30's,   then a virtual ghost town until it was bought up in 2006 and renovated into a quirky wilderness resort with resident highland cattle and a Pleasantville-esque string of gorgeously restored 1920's cottages. We stayed in the Superintendents Cottage, a beautiful house, built on a grand scale and full of ghosts but not the smell of ghosts, if you know what I mean. (Great for those with sinus or allergy issues.)</p>

<p The two littles loved sharing a room and judging from the hidden evidence discovered in the eight year old's queen-bed suite, Peanut spent the weekend luxuriously reading Jeffrey Archer short stories and eating sugar packets. Oh joy! That's about as good as life gets, no?</p>

<p I adored this sun drenched breakfast room where we ate all our meals. We had such nice weather that there was no chance to use the fireplace, but it does snow at Tarraleah.</p>

<p The houses are  decorated with a lovely eye for detail, but there was nothing delicate or fragile - nothing that we had to keep safe from the kids, who are in a big Hide and Seek phase.</p>

<p A piano, a lovely long hall made for chasings, and a good bath down the end. Hello Pudding! Wash your ears!</p>

<p There is neither mobile phone nor Internet access at Tarraleah village, which all adds to the retro charm of the place. I fact (set your nerd alarms.....NOW!) Keith, Peanut and I all spent some good hours engrossed in the 1964 Encyclopedia Britannica. Later we watched an Indiana Jones movie together, and Keith took the kids spotlighting with a torch (where they saw wallabies and possums and got thrillingly close to a creature that turned out to be a beer can on a rock.)</p>

<p In fact we saw a number of creatures on this trip. Driving into town we had to slow for a pair of chickens crossing the road (a great chance for Peanut and I to shout 'But why! Why! Tell us and solve the conundrum forever!' out the window) and at Tarraleah, apart from the resident Highland cattle, we had a kangaroo - with joey! - who liked to hang around outside our windows.</p>

<p On Saturday night, we spent an hour soaking in our undies in the hot tub that overlooks the cliffs below. It's beautiful - not perhaps, as relaxing as it might be for a couple celebrating their anniversary with a nice bottle of Tasmanian champagne, what with the three small children we had sharing the spa with us. Also, getting dressed later was a little fraught as we tried to contain our boisterous brood so as not to disturb the quiet massages going on in the rooms around us. In the melee, Keith left his underpants behind. Not just any undies, he says,  oh no: a lucky soccer pair. He wanted me to enquire about them at the front desk as I checked out, any maybe, if I could work it in, mention that he scored seven goals while wearing them.</p>

<p But friends,  in my thank-yous to the lovely Kirsty at reception the next morning, as I returned the spotlighting torch, the Indiana Jones DVD and the house keys, I could not bring myself to mention the underpants.In short, I  think I can sum it up  our visit to Tarraleah by paraphrasing that classic tourism proverb:</p>

<blockquote>'Take nothing but a Tupperware container full of insanely good turkey roulade*. Leave nothing but a pair of lucky underpants.'</blockquote>
