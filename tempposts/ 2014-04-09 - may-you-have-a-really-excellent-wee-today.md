## 9th April 2014

<p “To relieve a full bladder is one of the great human joys.”</p>

<p Photograph 1962,   by Manfred Kreiner,   Henry Miller's thoughts on urination via Maria Popova at <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/04/11/henry-miller-on-the-joy-of-urination/">Brain Pickings. </a></p>

Sometime we need Henry Miller to remind us to stop, be in the moment, and enjoy the small wondrous pleasures of being alive, like a nice wee.

Also from the wonderful old goat in 1950: “Develop an interest in life as you see it; the people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself.”
