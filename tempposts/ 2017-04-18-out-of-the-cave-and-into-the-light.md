# Out Of The Cave and Into The Light

## 18th April 2017

What happens now?

The love I feel for Ivy is intesne and my sense of panic is too: there is no getting out of this now. It is so all-consuming,   so overwhelming, that it swallows up so much of me that came before. And as I emerge, blinking, out of the cave of early childhood,into a new place where I am not needed so intimately, and yet still needed in this important, mundane service capacity, Iâ€™m not sure what to do next. I have to put the pieces together of my identity in this new form.
