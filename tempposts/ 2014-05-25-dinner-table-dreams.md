# Dinner Table Dreams

## 25th May 2014

Have you had a good weekend? We've been out in the garden,   out on the river,   pottering about. Keith is home from a trip away, the weather has been glorious and and life feels sweet.  Tonight, we all watched The Voice and then my seven year old and I gave Babooshka our best shot in a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners, hold-the-power-note  sing-off.  Even when the five year old climbed on the couch-stage and pretended to be a zombie eating our brains we did not break the fourth wall. Because we are **professional** **cheeseburgers**. It was the best way to end a gorgeous weekend.  I hope things are well for you too.

I have a dream. At times it feels like a hopeless fantasy that I cling to like a toddler hugs a stinky bear, but it’s my dream, and I’m very attached to it. It’s the dream of Family Dinner.

Every night at 6pm, I set the plates down and summon my husband and gang of three kids aged seven, five and two to the table. (This sounds very 50’s housewife. Let me just stress that Keith has his own zones of housework, but the kitchen is my domain. I like it in there.)

Generally, we encourage the art of conversation and gently, we teach table manners, but despite these efforts, the little ones behave like piglets on acid. The two year old sees a gathering of the whole family as a captive audience for lengthy stories about her dog Dodo’s wild imaginary parties. If she senses our interest flagging she gets down from the table and performs nude interpretive dance routines.  We all must watch and listen and we are violently chastised if we break attention.

Meanwhile, the five year old is  physically unable to stay in his seat, and if the seven year old does not like the look of dinner, she will pull an Oscar-worthy dramatic monologue about how sick she feels. (One time when Keith and I held firm on this obvious thespian display and insisted that she eat, she actually vomited onto her brown rice stir-fry.  We are still unsure whether it really was gastro or just method acting from a young master.)

At least 30% of the time Keith, who emerges at six from his office in the back garden, is staring into space, still immersed in some scientific problem. When we do manage conversation, it's constantly interrupted, usually by some act of naughtiness that has us both repeating ‘That’s one! That’s two!’ like a pair of demented mathematicians.

Still, I have a dream. I dream of the peaceful respite that the evening meal will bring to us at the end of the day.  Sometimes, I feel it near. There are glorious moments when all three children are quiet, seated right-side-up and eating. These moments are fleeting, and they end when a child is asked something wholesome and lovely like ‘What are you grateful for today?” and they answer ‘Poo,’ and then all three are splitting their sides with laughter, beating their fists on the  table in appreciation of the champagne wit of it all, and standing up to give their sibling comedian a standing ovation.

Still, I have a dream.  It’s of the wonderful Spanish concept ‘sombremesa’. That’s the period at the end of the meal when all dinner companions sit around happily playing cards, drinking wine and shooting the breeze. Ah, such a beautiful dream!  A dinner table where we gather and talk art, politics, and the details of our daily lives! Where people praise the meal instead of pretending to be too nauseous to eat it, or (in a more direct protest) throwing their plates in disgust! Where nobody is sent to the corner or loses their dessert! Where we share a meal with relatively well-adjusted humans rather than drunken Vikings and unpredictable, emotional strippers!

In ten years, my table might look closer to that particular fantasy. Then again, it might not. It’s all part of the same dream, after all – the one about family life, which never plays out exactly like the picture in my head. Always, it is messier, more unpredictable, and much, much richer. I’ll just keep slinging those plates on the table at six, and I’ll open my arms to that unexpected future, and all the family dinners I might be lucky enough to have. Whatever they look like.
