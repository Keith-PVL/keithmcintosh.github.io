# Bath Zen: Peace, Despite The Pong

## 12th March 2014

Life with three children under eight can be very busy and very noisy. Sometimes a mum needs a quiet space: a place to retreat,   to collect her thoughts,   and to eat slightly damp sandwiches.

For me, that place is the bath. This tub of scented, oily hot water is my happy place. It also serves as my first line of pain-management when dealing with my often recalcitrant and achy back.

I can easily spend an hour in there. I gather supplies with care: two or three books (in case I change my mind), my glasses, my phone, and snacks to keep my strength up through the session. Sometimes chocolate and nuts, maybe a tuna sandwich. On a special occasion, a full English roast. Usually I perch a cup of tea on the side.

Once submerged, I direct household proceedings as situations arise. I can take calls from my post;  comfort children’s meltdowns, referee mixed martial art battles and negotiate toddler tantrums. I can walk small people through emotional, physical and existential crises of varying kinds.

In the water, I try to reach the state of Bath Zen. It's not easy.  Usually I soak late at night, but sometimes I escape to the bath when my husband is on kid duty. The children are experts in peeling off from the pack, however. They sneak away from Dad, and then they come into the bathroom and badger me.

Where are the scissors? I need a sandwish. I need it right now! Peanut said that the Gipshuns pull brains out through their noses Mum.  Where are the scissors? Where is my sandwish? Peanut says she is going to pull my brains out of my nose.  With the scissors!   Mum. Mum. *Mum*! MUM!

The bath is placed in the centre of the house, next to the only toilet, and there are no locks. It is hard to maintain Bath Zen when children like to sing on the toilet, or talk me through their process, step by step.

I’m trying to reach Bath Zen when an unspeakable pong rises from the toilet next door. It becomes clear that a small child has begun evacuation proceedings before quite reaching the bowl. Evidence is revealed on the discarded pants that lie in the doorway. Sadly, the gentle aroma of my delicious bath oil is no match for the soiled undercrackers of a little boy who ate three helpings of lasagne last night.

Still, the warm embrace of the water on my sore back is worth it all. Things could be worse, I remind myself. A friend was once relaxing in her bath when a child poured a potty full of wee on her head.

I sink back, breathing deeply (oops, mistake, forgot about the pants), and open my book.

‘Mama, get out.’

It’s the two-year old.

‘Get Daddy,’ I encourage.  ‘Daddy will play with you!’

She narrows her eyes at me suspiciously.

‘Get outa bath, Mama. Make me pea-butter toase.’

I position the book between her face and mine and try to imagine I am swinging in a hammock on a tropical beach. Peace is flowing, like a river.

‘Do it now pease.’

Flowing like a gently mountain stream.

‘Do it Mama!’

Flowing…like ….a…

‘GET OUTA BATH MAMA!’

That’s my cue. Time’s up. Wrinkled and pruney, stripped of a layer of stress and dead skin cells, I haul my old bones out of the water, put my clothes back on and re-enter the fray of family life. It’s chaotic, it’s energetic, and it’s lovely. I pat the side of my cold, pale beloved. I’ll be back soon, bath.

Just got to wash some pants.
