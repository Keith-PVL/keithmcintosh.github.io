# Modern Parenting: All Joy And No Fun?

## 12th February 2014

<p A great interview recently on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/">Fresh Air podcast</a> with Jennifer Senior, author of All Joy And No Fun: The Paradox Of Modern Parenthood. 'Have we become a nation of Jeeves,' asks Senior, ' running after after all these little Bertie Woosters?'</p>

How I laughed, as I fluffed the children's pillow-protectors and polished the little bells they ring when their noses are itchy.

Senior looks at the historical point where parenthood became sentimentalised, muses on the cultural shift from 'housewife' to 'stay-at-home-mum', and talks about the differences between 'drone' (our parents style) and 'helicopter' parenting (the modern way).

<blockquote>All of us feel like we have to be deeply, aggressively interactive and I'm not clear on whether or not kids benefit from that. I mean people are looking at that now and claiming that it's backfiring and that this form of helicoptering is not as good for a child's self-esteem as the kind of drone model that our parents had, which was kind of like they were more remote. I have to say, I think it's really hard on parents.</blockquote>
