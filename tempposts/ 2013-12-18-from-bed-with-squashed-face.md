# From Bed With Squashed Face

## 18th December 2013

Prego.

I'm in bed.

My sinuses are so clogged that I can't smell anything. I feel like my hearing is impaired too ( can this be real? am I imagining this? I don't even know.) My face hurts. Also, my hip is reminding me it exists with little ominous twinges of pain-hellos.

At the minute I'm eliminating dairy which sucks dog balls because coffee. **Coffee**.

I have forty minutes left until the school, pre-school and day care pickup begins, and then...school holidays. Which, despite my best efforts,  tend to play out <a href="http://mogantosh.com/on-school-holidays-or-mayday-mayday-the-monkeys-have-destroyed-the-lab/">like this. </a>

This is my last writing Wednesday for some weeks. Please send tiny violins, Valium, Mary Poppins and an attitude adjustment machine  fitted with a high-pressure nose hose  to my bed.

In the next thirty-five minutes.
