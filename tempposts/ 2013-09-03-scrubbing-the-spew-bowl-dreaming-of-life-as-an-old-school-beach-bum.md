# Scrubbing The Spew Bowl, Dreaming Of Life As An Old-School Beach Bum

## 3rd September 2013

If you see me down at the shops this week wearing a necklace made of garlic and carrying a crucifix,   just make sympathetic faces and throw holy water on me from a safe distance. We are trapped  in the evil embrace of some kind of magical reappearance virus. The big ones need a lot of looking after,   but are at least  happy to listen to stories and watch Cake Boss and do craft. If they were the only inhabitants of my mobile hospital it wouldn't be so tough.

The baby, however...She's recovering now,  but there were some miserable midnight hours, when my sunny-natured toddler morphed into a sort of nasty CEO.  'Get me what I want!' she shouted at me in her broken English.  ' This milk will make me feel good again! Get it faster, dammit!  Oh, screw you, you idiot! What, you've got cloth in your ears? This milk is not making me happy like I thought it would! Get me the other thing! The juice! The juice! What? This juice sucks too! You're fired.'

Let's just say that if I am ever berated by an angry, incontinent foreigner I will have some experience to draw on.

Still, two weeks ago I was looking after these kids while in the grip of the virus myself, and that was **so** much worse. My mum and friends have been dropping off water, pesto, hydration icy-poles and -best of all- something called called 'Herman The German Sourdough Friendship Cake.' Silver linings.

Meanwhile, I am bleaching everything that I can reach and fantasising about the lazy, sunny life of a 50's beach bum. Not a spew bucket or a can of Glen 20 in sight, and - I am almost positive -  nobody shouting 'Mummy! I need you!'

Here's to sunshine ahead.
