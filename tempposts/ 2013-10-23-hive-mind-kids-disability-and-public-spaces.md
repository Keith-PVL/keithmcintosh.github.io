# Hive Mind: Kids, Disability and Public Spaces

## 23rd October 2013

Welcome to the second in the Hive Mind series,   where we look at issues that unite us, and share our ideas about how to live well. Today: kids with disabilities and how welcome they are in public spaces.

Those of us with small children are used to those moments when kids break unspoken rules about public spaces. When I was out with small T-Bone recently, he stripped to his undies to play in a children’s water park. I quickly intervened when he pulled his johnson out and started to wee merrily into a drain, but a man sitting nearby gave me a very dirty look. I glared at him in return, for breaking the rule of older men sitting alone to watch half-naked children frolic.

There are lots of unstated, accepted rules about shared public areas. Usually, they are easy enough to follow and people are generally easygoing about the predictable lunacy of small children.  But what do you do when your child has a disability that means they might behave in unexpected or odd ways? In a slate.com article entitled <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/03/autism_in_the_community_how_should_public_spaces_be_shared.html">Where Should Special Needs Kids Be Special</a>? Amy Lutz explored what this means for her and her ten year son Jonah, who has autism. What are her rights and responsibilities as the parent of a child with a disability, she wonders? And what are the rights and responsibilities of the general public?  ‘It’s not OK to be offended by the sight of disabled people in the community or to insult them or their family members’, Lutz says. ‘However, neither is it OK for anyone, disabled or not, to engage in dangerous, illegal, and/or unsanitary behaviors. Pretty broad parameters, no doubt, but hopefully ones we can all agree on. Where it gets tricky is in the middle.’

The middle ground, Lutz says, is where we need to develop a framework of reasonable expectations. Like many autistic individuals, Jonah is virtually incapable of doing anything quietly, Lutz says. ‘He has been scowled at on airplanes, in movie theaters, in restaurants, and in bookstores. And I get it — I prefer a quiet airplane ride as much as the next person. But what I keep coming back to is that *community*, by definition, is inclusive. Ideally, our public spaces should accommodate everyone. Which means that expecting kids like Jonah to just stay home isn’t reasonable. Nor should we think of this issue in terms of what discomfort or awkwardness people without disabilities are willing to tolerate, because that suggests a troubling hierarchy of privilege. Instead, we need to ask ourselves how best to share our common facilities.’

I put the question to a couple of experts. Lisa is an Australian special needs teacher who blogs at <a href="http://waltzingmatildamummy.blogspot.com.au/">Waltzing With Matilda</a>. She compares the experience of being in public with a child with autism to being a mother. ‘Every now and again, when your baby or toddler is screaming in the supermarket, you get a look, usually from an elderly person who has lost their ability to be patient in the regression of their neuro flexibility, or sometimes a man with anger that’s lurking beneath the surface looking for a reason to explode. But I think most people really want to do the right thing, help out where they can and do accept.’

Entering the public sphere can take hard work from parents, Lisa says, describing the intricate preparations that can come with preparing a child with autism for an outing into a new environment. ‘It can involve using visuals, photos, social stories, getting a copy of the menu in advance and talking about options, writing down the steps involved in the outing. All of this minimises anxiety and more extreme behaviours.'

It’s a juggle for  parents, Lisa says, between their desires to take their child into the community to practice appropriate behaviours and enjoy life, and staying home where life is easier, and there is no need to deal with other (potentially hostile) people.  ‘The public has a responsibility to accept and be kind towards non neuro-typical people,' Lisa says, ‘seeing it as another way of being. Just like black and white skin, straight and gay people, neurotypical is not the 'only' way.’

‘I think it's a tough one’, says Veronica Foale, who blogs at <a href="http://somedaywewillsleep.com/">Sleepless Nights </a>and has two children on the autism spectrum. ‘For me, public spaces are for the public and children - special needs or not, can't be expected to learn how to behave in public if they're never there, you know? I also think that as a whole, communities have forgotten how to be empathetic to parents. There are a lot of people who think they know how they'd do it better and how we ought to be parenting - special needs or not.'

On the wide range of the autism spectrum sit about 1 in 100 Australian children, and while numbers vary, its generally agreed that there has been a steady rise in the incidence and prevalence of the disorder.  For parents of children with more severe autism, it can be like parenting an 18 month old child, says Lisa, where you know to avoid public spaces unless armed with major food weapons and toy distraction. ‘The difference is that for most parents,  this phase passes. If you have a child with Autism, it never, ever passes. And these families have as much right to use public space as anyone else.’

‘ I wonder if it's just invisible disabilities that get judged so harshly?’ asks Veronica. ‘A drooling, shouting five year old who looks otherwise competent is likely to be treated differently to the same five year old in a wheelchair. I'm lucky I guess, because Amy is a girl, she's a lot more sensitive to social graces and has learned them pretty well. She's just quirky in her obsessions and concentration now, not difficult in public, and Isaac withdraws entirely because he finds it all so overwhelming, so he's easy - unless you want to speak to him.’

Lisa agrees. ‘For some reason, little children who are profoundly disabled in wheel chairs pose little threat to 'others' ability to enjoy public space,  because they can look away, they don’t need to react or respond physically cause the child is in a wheel chair. It seems the same for other sensory disabilities, like children/people with vision impairments, but for some reason, autistic children or those with other disabilities that involve noise or behaviour that is not 'contained' or 'controlled' seem to pose a threat to others, because they don’t know how to react, or because they don’t understand, or they disapprove of the parenting.’

Still, most people do manage to do the right thing, Lisa says. ‘After my experience of years and years of taking children into the community, most people want to help, feel empathy and are enriched by the experiences of children with disabilities.' In the end, Veronica says she tries not to think a bout other people too much. 'My children are human beings with their own wants and desires. I let them know how I expect them to behave and provide consequences, but it's up to them to actually do it.’

This video is a set-up from an American show called What Would You Do? They use actors to play out a scene in a restaurant where a family is struggling to keep their  child with autism in his seat. An actor plays a disgruntled customer so annoyed by the boy that he tells off the dad. Other diners come to the defence of the family and eventually, the restaurant erupts in applause when the angry diner leaves. It's heartwarming to me because it speaks to the inherent good spirit of most of us - the other customers are silent while the boy is noisy, but they are silent in support, not condemnation. We are all in this together, raising these kids, sharing this space.
