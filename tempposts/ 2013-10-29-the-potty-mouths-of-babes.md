This week:

From horrified 2 year old as she watches me work the neti pot (this chronic sinusitis is killing me): 'That escusting! Dop it Mama! Dop! That escusting!'

From thoughtful 5 year old,   to me and his physicist father,    'When I grow up, I will do a useful job. Not like a scientist or a writer.'

From mischievous 7 year old, in front of school mum I know only a little:  'Mum, why do you say 'fuck' and 'shit' all the time?' (This joke got such a good reaction that she did it again, in front of a new victim, the next day. She has promised that she won't crack that gag again but we both did laugh a lot, later. I had to credit her comic timing. )

Life with kids can be stressful.

But god it's funny.
