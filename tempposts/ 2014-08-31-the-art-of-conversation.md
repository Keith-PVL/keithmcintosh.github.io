'I love you,   Pudding',   I told my sweet three-year old in the car this week.

'I know,  ' she replied. 'But 'I love Daddy the best.'

'That's not so nice to say that', I said. Pudding was confused.

'I not say I hate you,' she explained.  'I just mean Dad's better than you.'

'Yes,' I said. I thought I'd drop it. It reminded me of the time a two-year old Peanut summoned me to her room at 2am to tell me the same thing. Thanks, ladies. I'll just go wash some more of your clothes, shall I?

But I've confused poor young Pudding. Yesterday she asked 'Is this a swear word? I like you best Mummy. Is that a swear? What one is a swear?"

'Look,' I said. 'It's not a big deal Pudding. In this family we try and make our words be kind and nice to each other. We try not to say things that make each other feel sad. Do you understand?"

I called in the seven-year-old. 'Peanut, you tell your sister the kinds of things you would not say.'

'OK,' she said. 'Like, don't say YOU DON'T REALLY BELONG IN THIS FAMILY! WE BOUGHT YOU FROM SOME GYPSIES!"

Thanks', I said.

As you were, girls. You'll figure it out.

Happy Monday folks. My your day be full of love and laughter. My littles have just appeared requesting Turkish toast with honey and bananas. Must report for duty.
