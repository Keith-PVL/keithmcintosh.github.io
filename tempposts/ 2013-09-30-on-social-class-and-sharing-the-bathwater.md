# On Social Class And Sharing The Bathwater

## 30th September 2013

I pondered a little today as I sorted an obscene pile of laundry on my bed and listened to an episode of the BBC4 podcast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s8mp5">Thinking Allowed</a> which explored the growing social trend for the middle classes in Asia to gather in massive gated communities. One described in China housed 50,   000 people. Another,   built along the coast,   featured hidden speakers behind the palm trees, which played birdsong to enhance the atmosphere. Crazy. Fascinating.

In the course of life, one sociologist said, people may move up and down social classes as they build and lose economic and social capital. Yes! I thought.  This year we sent Keith's old caravan office to the scrap yard. He's working now in a beautiful, tranquil little office space built out the back, on the site of the old cow shed. In the caravan, he was used to spiders dropping on his head and possums fighting in the roof. He froze in winter and sweltered in summer. It was not salubrious.

Somehow, over the years, we had amassed a little collection of defunct whitegoods that we stored in a sad little pile out the front, where they waited for us to organise a trip to the tip. Broken strollers, dead ovens, spineless umbrellas;  all gathered together at the front door like some kind of contemporary installation called 'Suburban Welfare Graveyard'.

We manhandled them all into the caravan, before we sent them to their final end at the scrap yard.  Inspired by all the open space, Keith built a boot shelf at the front door, and we hung out our new cast-iron doorbell. Goodbye, derelict caravan! Hello, middle class!

The podcast finished though with a final piece of advice that brought me back to ground. Regardless of income, cultural interests and general swankiness, one contributor advised, if you share the bathwater, you can only be working class. Ah, well, I thought. That's me back in my box. At least, until I install some hidden speakers playing pan-flute  behind the trees in the garden.  I may yet raise our standing.

(By the way, K-Dogs office was designed and built by the brilliant <a href="http://www.barnaclestudio.com.au/COWSHED-1">Barnacle Studios</a>. )
