# The First Week Of School Is Like Being Branded By 1950's Pygmies

## 5th February 2014

My kindy boy is home sick today. He's watching Play School now,  wrapped in a blanket and happy to have some down-time. This starting- school business has been intense.

I am reminded that in order for things to run smoothly around here,   I need to get my domestic engineers hat on (beaver-skin pelt,   sequinned, single eagle feather) and start planning our time well to avoid meltdowns - both adult and child versions. Invitations to play, good hefty afternoon teas, study and craft set up on the big table...it's all coming back to me now.

Next week Ill shift myself up a gear, into Term Mum. This week, I' m surfing the tide, dispensing lots of cuddles, reading Mr Men books, and in my own down-time, settling in to enjoy stolen moments with my new boyfriend Colin Turnbull.

This is Colin.

Oh **stop** it Colin. Stop it with those eyes.

Colin is an Oxford-eddercated anthropologist who spent time in the 50's living with the Mbuti pygmy tribe of Zaire.  I'm a deeply enjoying his book 'The Forest People' and only sad that this author photo was taken before his pygmy friends cut three small holes in his forehead and rubbed ash into them, branding him as a friend.  It all happened rather suddenly and Colin had to sit on a log, 'not feeling very bright.'

I know how Colin feels. First week back at school is a a little disorienting too, and there may be some scarring. But best foot forward! Play School's finished. Time to swipe on to sick bay. x
