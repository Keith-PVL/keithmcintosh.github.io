<p Here's tyhe newspaper article: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2582334/Mollycoddled-kids-grow-narcissists-Psychologist-warns-growth-play-dates-supervised-adults-creating-generation-children-empathise.html</p>

<p So as is the way with little girls, there were a few rumblings in the Year 2 friendship circle recently.  I feel a little hot and fluffy at just the thought of a kid feeling left out or  feeling excluded from a gang. So I had this brilliant idea that since one of our circle of mums is a child psychologist, it would be a really great and lovely idea to have a little session with the girls; gently chaired by this kindly mum, where they played a few conflict-resolution' or 'trust' games...workshopped some strategies on dealing with freindship.</p>

<p I am hesitant to say that i may even have used the phrase 'so that we are all on the same page'.</p>

<p I set off the group email, and then Keith happened to walk in. Oh, listen to this wonderful idea I just had! I said to him, and then I watched his face assume the (sadly, familiar) look of bemused confusion. Gently, he pointed out that it was perhaps important for children to figure these things out in the rough-and-tumble of the playground, and that even if that process might not be a structured and pain-free as my proposed educational  workshop I had proposed;</p>

‘By definition, free play is an activity that any player is free to quit at any time. Children know that. Their very strong drive to play leads them to behave in ways that reduces the chance that the others will quit, and that means paying attention to the others’ needs and wishes,’ he said.

‘To play with other children you must please them as well as yourself, and that means that you have to get into the others’ heads and figure out what they like and don’t like.

He blames the ‘schoolish’ view of child development – the idea that children gain more from doing what adults tell them to do than from their own self-directed activities - as a key reason for the decline of free play.

‘Even out of school children today are far more likely to be in adult-directed activities and less likely to be playing with other kids on their own than was true in the past,’ he said.

‘As a society we have lost touch with the meaning of childhood.  We no longer think of it as a time of play, but increasingly think of it as a time of résumé building.  That is a huge mistake.’

Additionally, fears about safety mean children are often no longer allowed to play in their neighbourhoods without adult supervision.

Dr Gray advises that, where a ‘play date’ situation is unavoidable, adults should make themselves scarce as much as possible.

‘It depends on the age of the children, but for children aged four and older the parents should, to the degree possible, vanish. Even if they are present with no intention to intervene, they may not be able to avoid intervening.

‘When adults are present, children in our culture look to the adults to solve their problems rather than figure out how to solve them themselves.

‘If an adult can’t literally leave, then she or he should be very busy with adult things – too busy to be interrupted, and should not allow interruption.

‘Trust breeds trustworthiness. Children are far more competent – far more able to take responsibility for themselves and one another – than most of us give them credit for, but they need the freedom to practise that responsibility or else it atrophies.’
