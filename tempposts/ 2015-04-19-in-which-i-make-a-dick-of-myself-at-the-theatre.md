# In Which I Make A Dick Of Myself at The Theatre

## 19th April 2015

Well,   here we are,   at the tail end of the school holidays. <a href="http://mogantosh.com/on-school-holidays-or-mayday-mayday-the-monkeys-have-destroyed-the-lab/">Not always the easiest couple of weeks</a>. We've had a really relaxed  time these holidays though,   thanks to a gentle cold that has lazily passed its way between all the members of the family - one ill, one better, one relapse, one recovery...so my general  'snot be green, don't let them be seen' philosophy has kept us fairly well contained to barracks most of the time.

It's been nice, very restorative to spend some time in the bubble. We're deep into this excellent board game called Settlers of Catan, which involves a lot of intense resource trading.  We're reading Treasure Island and Nanny McPhee out loud. Cooking a lot. Holding some family dance parties. In fact, Keith pulled some sort of a muscle dancing to Whams Bad Boys today and even though he may not want that made public it is absolutely beyond my control not to share it.

In this spirit of disclosure I should confess that I made an absolute gold standard dick of myself yesterday.

My mum very generously took my sister Sam, my sis in-law Karla and me to see Les Miserables in Sydney this weekend. It was a great show, a packed house. In the second act, during an emotional solo, my water bottle suddenly rolled away from my feet. I was sitting in the aisle and I made a terrible split second decision to jump up and grab it.

Unfortunately, the slope was quite steep and the bottle picked up speed.  I tried to dash quickly so I could grab it fast, but it took me six or seven rows to get it. Once I was up and running, I was sort of trapped in the hideous moment. I'd started something and I had to play it out. My feet gallumped loudly - somebody yelped 'Jesus!' and the usher ran after me. I must have looked like a sudden madwoman about to storm the stage.

I dashed back and sat down as soon as I could. Sam, Mum and Karla were looking at me in horror. 'You looked like a bloody cheetah!' Sam whispered. All the seats around me were laughing. I thought I could not be  more ashamed until I realised that my high-waisted 'mom jeans' were fully unzipped. I'm used to getting away with undoing the top button when I settle in and let my gut relax, but- take note ladies! - it's harder to get away with that when your  zip is a bloody foot long.

Sam re-enacted it for me when we got home. Oh, the shame! The shame. I blame genetics-  evidenced by this story I recounted a long time ago in a post about my Mum:

<blockquote>One of Mum's oldest friends is a bush poet. After working for years on a script on the Eureka Stockade, she got the chance to stage a reading for a group of investors at a city theatre. The audience was full of hard-nosed business types, me, and Mum, who was bursting with pride and excitement. At the shows conclusion, everybody clapped politely, but Mum was out of step with the vibe of the crowd. She leapt to her feet, cheering wildly, and then tried to sit down again when she realised that nobody else was getting up. Unfortunately, the chair beneath her folded up in the meantime, so she landed on the floor. Can you picture it? Gymnastic leap in the air, with clapping, to full floor finish. Priceless.</blockquote>

My daughters probably have this gene too. Soz girls. It's beyond our control.
