# Great Stuff To Read

## 14th February 2015

Column: The Secret Life Of Marrieds...(for ideas maybe? column to pitch post PP?)Â http://www.cosmopolitan.com/author/1679/jane-marie/

It's all interviews - this is a really,   really cool idea; start with a few interviews and get the ball rolling, then send it out to places on sepc.

 

eg - matt and shirin, carly and adam, al and hall, sam and chris even...

 

Behins Closed Doors, B=etween The Sheets, The Marriage Insider...
