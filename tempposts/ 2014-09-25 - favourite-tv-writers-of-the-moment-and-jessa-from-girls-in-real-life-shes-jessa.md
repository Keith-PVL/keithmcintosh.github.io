# Favourite TV Writers of The Moment (And Jessa from Girls In Real Life: She's Jessa!)

## 25th September 2014

Are you a Girls fan? I am. Keith and I have just finished a leisurely run through season 3. We dragged it out for a while.  Good season.  I love Lena Dunham - I think she's one of the most original and interesting writers of the moment.

In Australia,   I feel the same way about Josh Thomas and <a href="http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/please-like-me/MP1439H118C00DS1">Please Like Me</a>. Do you watch this one? I love the way they come at life:  starting from their own quirky personalities,   mining their own quirks with awkwardness and honesty, and  then branching out into relationships and the cultural moment. They both leave me with lots of stuff to chew on and think over. Plus, they're both hilarious.

Anyway, if you're not a Girls fan, get back to training your falcon or whatever.

If you are, check these pictures out. It's Jemima Kirke, the actress who plays Jessa.  And she is **so** Jessa that it's hilarious.
