# Radio Silence

## 31st March 2014

Ooh lordy.

The toilet fan keeps breaking down #composting dunny #stinkybusiness

The water pump keeps breaking down #sadface #sadanddirty

On Friday we had to choose between running water or our own poo-smell pervading every inch of the house #sophieschoice #wannacomeover?

On Sunday,   Keith stumbled upon some sort of tick-nest from hell and had more than 100 ticks. #ouch #bumtickbum

My sinuses are sore and I'm just all tuckered out #surgery #facescrape #hotmess

My laptop has caught a virus and is in the electronics hospital waiting attention #longwait #comutersaysno

In short, #tinyviolins
