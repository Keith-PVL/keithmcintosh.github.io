# A New Project, A Welcome Post, And One Attractive Man Speaking French

## 28th August 2013

Hello,   my friends,   and thanks for checking in with me at this new blog.  My friend Chrystie helped me move across to Wordpress - check out <a href="http://garnishgarden.com/">her site</a> if you need any graphic design magic. I am fumbling my way through figuring out this new platform,   so please know that anything that looks nice here is Chrystie's work, and the clunky bits all belong to me.

I have such a yawning hole in my brain-case where the technology stuff should go. Hopefully I will get better at using Wordpress over time - any hints gladly accepted - but in the meantime, I am just going to press blindly  forward and make it up as I go along. Much like life really.

Welcome! Welcome!  I am so looking forward to this new phase of  life and writing. If you would like to subscribe to Mogantosh by email or with Bloglovin, there are little widgets on this page somewhere. And as a little gift from me to you, here is Bradley Cooper speaking French.
