# Seven Years Old Daughters Will Not Do What You Think They Will

## 11th March 2014

I have three kids,   aged two,   five and seven. The eldest is at that age where she can do lots of things, and so I let her do lots of things, until she does something that makes me remember 'ah, small unfinished frontal lobe combined with eccentric personality, that's right...'

Peanut was invited to a friends birthday party on the weekend (<a href="http://mogantosh.com/watch-out-for-seven-year-olds-both-fabulous-and-tricky/">this friend, in fact</a>). I pulled a favourite Roald Dahl book from the present box, and explained to Peanut that it was nice to write something inside the book so your friend would always remember that birthday. I thought 'nice note' was enough direction but I returned to find the careful inscription: 'Happy birthday to you. Go and look  in the loo. You will find something stinky. It's a present for you!'  I got Peanut to add a tiny 'I love you' in the space that was left but it was clearly an afterthought.

Next I sent her off to 'put on something nice'. She came back in a Bart Simpson t-shirt (a present from Pop, thanks Dad) that reads in loud, entitled letters 'It's not my fault!' , teamed with a pair of old leggings that sported a massive hole in the crotch. I couldn't save the present but I did edit the outfit.

Daughters!

In good news, <a href="http://mogantosh.com/impending-peeny-disaster/">a Peeny update:</a> in the best outcome possible, the Girl Guides did not manage to smash Peeny. They made a hole large enough to get the lollies out (not even the black dogs of war could stand between a dozen children and a bag of sour worms) but Peeny came home, intact.

I adore this crazy kid.
