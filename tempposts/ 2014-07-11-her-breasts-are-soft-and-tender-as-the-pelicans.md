# Her Breasts Are Soft And Tender As The Pelicans

## 11th July 2014

School holidays are nearly over - back to normal routines next week. How did you go? My second week has been much easier than the first - I'm feeling much healthier: more energetic,   less emotional. We've had lots of extra kids this week - I just keep feeding them. If they come to complain,   I stick a banana in their mouth before they can get the sentence out. Then I perform the classic mime 'Trapped In A Box With Michael Flatley' until they they leave the kitchen,   confused.

Games of Garden Masterchef have been popular (complicated leaf art and grated oranges), the dolls house is having a revival and magazine collages are hot right now.  When Keith comes up for lunch it's easy to persuade him onto the piano. In my world, there is no fun like christian-strumming four guitar chords and belting Katy Perry numbers with theatrical seven year olds who haven't yet learned about self-consciousness.

How long do you think we've got before the fact that Dad can (and will ) play Let It Go with Liberace-esque flourish  is not longer amazingly cool to Peanut but...the opposite? Don't tell me.

ps - Unrelated, but fabulous: Pick-up lines from 1663. Your mission for tonight, should you choose to accept it: use one of these lines, then reach behind your ear and waggle your reading glasses slowly, sensuously, erotically.  (Extra points if you dress like <a href="http://www.sadanduseless.com/2012/04/lavatory-self-portraits/">this</a>. )  Go get em, tigers. Thank me later.

<blockquote>“Liquorous rolling eyes.”

“Her Cheeks are spread with Spices and Flowers.”

“Her breasts are the soft Pillows of love.”

“Her breasts are soft and tender as the Pelican’s.”

“In that sweet dimple, when she smiles, Cupid hath pitch’d his tents.”

“Her Thighes are fit subjects for the pleasant Songs of youthfull Poets to acquaint the world with.”

“Her legs as stately and firm as marble pillars.”
