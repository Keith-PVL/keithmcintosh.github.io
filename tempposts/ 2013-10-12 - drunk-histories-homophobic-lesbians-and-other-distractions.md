Quick - what's more pathetic that a mother who has lost her voice hopelessly croak-shouting at a naughty five-year-old?

Nothing.  It's the most pathetic. It's a sad,   sad place to be.  We're all still quarantined with measles,   I'm sick, sick, sick  (please not with measles! I'm immunised, so I'm almost fully protected, but SO WAS THE BABY! *chokes sob back with open palm* *fans tears from eyes**shakes fist angrily at sky*). And **scene**.

Ok, better now. One more day until the big daddy returns, and I'm counting down the hours. It's been a bastard run.  When friends are sick or bed ridden I like to try and remember cheery stuff I've seen around, so they can trick their brains into thinking that life doesn't suck for a few minutes. Here's my list:

In <a href="http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</a>, Jerry Seinfeld cruises around LA in a different car and with a different comedian each episode. My favourite: a satisfyingly absurdist outing with Kramer.

In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/7minutesinheaven">Seven Minutes In Heaven</a>, comic Mike O'Brien interviews celebrities in his closet and ends, always,  with a wonderfully awkward kiss. Ellen Degeneres is hilarious.

I really loved <a href="http://theslopeshow.com/episodes/">Park Slope</a>, a web series about 'superficial, homophobic lesbians.'

In <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/drunkhistory">Drunk Histor</a>y, actors get incontinent-inebriated and then relate historical moments while a cast reenacts their tale, including the lip-syncs.  So bad, so funny.

Got more? Tell me, please.

As for tonight, it's 8pm, all the bobos are tucked in, and I am taking to bed with a block of dark chocolate and Season 2 of Sister Wives. I am so strung out right now that I could weep into my keyboard at the glorious notion of having a few sister wives to share the load. But what's more pathetic than a woman crying over her lack of a plural marriage?

Don't answer that.
