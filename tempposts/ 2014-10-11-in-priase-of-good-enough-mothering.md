# In Priase of Good-Enough Mothering

## 11th October 2014

what i'm good it. cooking,   reading,   conversations in the car,   lightheartedness and singing and i give them lots and lots oif affectuin. lounge room dancing.trying to be kind to their dad.

was much better at craft with just one kid and even two.

im shit because of my back and becasue of my opersonality.

when i'm shit, as in,making them watch House Hunters Interbational instead of that last twnety minute off to bed.

you suck at the gymn )maynot not this story)

needing to exit out with my back, isolate.

annoued when they interrupt my radio program, the thing that is makig the washing upAGAIN bearabvle.

I need that stuff.

Other mums might need a lot of exercise time, time out with their friernmds, wine.

I'm happy inthe dopmestic zne,

but its ok to be shit at some parts

of course im lucky to have a partner to fill in the blanks.

single parentsa are amazing.

 

And thats fiune!

The kids are just people too, perfectly imperfect. Ill save the guilty energy forsomething else.
