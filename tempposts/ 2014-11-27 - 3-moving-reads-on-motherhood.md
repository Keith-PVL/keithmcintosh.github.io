<h6 <a href="http://www.shorpy.com/node/1470">Rural mother,   1936,   from the Shorpy Historical Archives. </a></h6>

A few articles and essays on motherhood that I've loved recently:

1. <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2014/october/1412085600/helen-garner/mother-courage">Helen Garner meets with Rosie Batty</a>,   Victorian Australian Of The Year and domestic violence campaigner, whose young son was killed so horribly last February. Helen Garner, a writer I adore,  has a magical gift of zoning in on the small, quiet details.

<blockquote>The architecture of Rosie Batty’s face may be monumental, but the air around her is so clear that one can ask her anything.</blockquote>

2. '<a href="http://benandbirdy.blogspot.com.au/2014/11/this-is-adolescence-14.html">This Is Fourteen</a>': Catherine Newman's gorgeous contribution to the 'This Is Adolescence' essay series.

<blockquote>

<div>Coming in from his monthly lawn mowing, Fourteen manages to communicate more overheatedness than a supernova. He flops on the couch, conspicuously fanning himself, and asks, breathless and, it would appear, having a small stroke, if you wouldn’t mind getting him a glass of ice water. You bring him the water, then can’t help yourself. “Fourteen,” you say, “it’s, like, ten square feet of mowing. I think you’ll be okay.” “You’re welcome,” Fourteen says. You’d love to stay and argue, but you have to rush out and buy him pants, pants, and more pants. The getting of pants is your new full-time job. If you listen hard in the night, you can hear his legs growing.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Speaking of the night: Fourteen no longer looks like a baby while he sleeps. For years, even as his limbs stretched and dangled, his dreaming face regressed to the contours of infancy: downy cheeks, pearl of nose, the pink, pouched lips of a nursling. But now that it’s been kiln-fired, the face has taken this opportunity to chisel out its jutting new edges: brow and jaw, nose and chin. Like a Neanderthal crossed with a peach.</div></blockquote>

<div>3. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.html?_r=0">When Siri became a boy with autism's BFF. </a> I really love this Mum, just trying to figure shit out.</div>

<div>

<blockquote>

<p itemprop="articleBody" data-para-count="473" data-total-count="2928">It’s not that Gus doesn’t understand Siri’s not human. He does — intellectually. But like many autistic people I know, Gus feels that inanimate objects, while maybe not possessing souls, are worthy of our consideration. I realized this when he was 8, and I got him an iPod for his birthday. He listened to it only at home, with one exception. It always came with us on our visits to the Apple Store. Finally, I asked why. “So it can visit its friends,” he said.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody" data-para-count="707" data-total-count="3635">So how much more worthy of his care and affection is Siri, with her soothing voice, puckish humor and capacity for talking about whatever Gus’s current obsession is for hour after hour after bleeding hour?</p>
