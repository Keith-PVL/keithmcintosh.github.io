# Bookshelf: 5 Great Books To Read Aloud To Young Kids

## 2nd April 2014

Research shows that reading aloud to kids from the ages of three through first grade is a great predictor of future academic success. You can take or leave that if you like,   but what's true for us is that the ritual of curling up together at the end of the day and spending some quiet time immersed in another world is really a beautiful thing.

To stick through a chapter book night after night can be tough when the book itself is badly written (I'm looking at you,   Wiggles marketing department.) Here are five that we have found to be enjoyable for both reader **and** listener.

**Anna Hibiscus**

Anna is a little girl who lives in Africa. 'Amazing Africa!' Her adventures are presented in short,   easy-chunk stories in a series. These moral fables are modern, but have an old-timey charm. Adult readers will love the eccentric characters in Anna's family, and the books are excellent for early readers to read alone as well. Anna is seriously adorable.

**Wonder**

My hands-down favourite book of recent times, Wonder spends a year in the life of August, a fifth-grader with a cranio-facial deformity. It's beautifully written from a number of different perspectives, and I cried floods of tears at the finish. Seven year old Peanut turned straight to page 1 and started reading it again, and we've had several interesting conversations about disability and kids and school since.

**The Faraway Tree**

Enid Blyton's classic series is a perennial favourtiet in this house, and the audio-book series is beautiful too. Both Peanut and 5 year old T-Bone love these whimsical stories about a gang of children adventuring in magical lands like 'All You Can Eat' and 'Do What You Like'.

**Nim's Island**

This was young Peanuts first favourite chapter book. She read it over and over (and watched the movie too. ) Eleven-year-old Nim lives on a tropical island with just her Dad and her animal friends. She's feisty, practical and adept at bushcraft: a really interesting heroine.

**Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone**

Peanut is all about Harry Potter these days, and there was a huge, wailing meltdown when I recently told her she'd have to wait a while before reading on after the third book. It pained me too - I don't like book censorship! But needs msut. I have the graphic novel series about Hilda in mind for her in replacement.
