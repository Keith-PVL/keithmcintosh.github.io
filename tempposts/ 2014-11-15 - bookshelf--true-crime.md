the fact of an ongoing story that needs to be neatly tied - it is a brain excercise grappling with the insustence of a writer that thei version is truth - they are trying to tidy up the messy reality - and theknowledge that another perpesctive could do the same differently.

My ecxperinece counslelluing children in secxual assualty court cases taught me that the job of a prosecutor is to tell a story,   and the job of the defence is to tell an alternatuve story.

Stories like the Gordon Wood tale - finally he's brought to juustice - yet, he has soince been aqquoitted.

Stories like Amanda Knox -many versions. One of the best is Fata;l Beauty - nbow, she's awaiing, and is awaited extradition.
