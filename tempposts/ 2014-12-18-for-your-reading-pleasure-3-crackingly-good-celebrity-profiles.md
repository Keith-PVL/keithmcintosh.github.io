# For Your Reading Pleasure: 3 Crackingly Good Celebrity Profiles

## 18th December 2014

Imma let you finish,   but <a href=": http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/music/kanye-west-talks-about-his-career-and-album-yeezus.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;://">this profile of Kanye West</a> is brilliantly funny.

I wish the enigmatic Tilda Swinton was my spirit animal (my actual spirit animal is probably closer to Mister Bean). Tilda <a href="http://www.gq.com/moty/2014/tilda-swinton-woman-of-the-year">smells like 'wildflowers and wood smoke' </a>apparently.

Finally, MONA founder and crazy gambling fool <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2013/february/1366597433/richard-flanagan/gambler">Richard Walsh is a fascinating study</a>.

Make a cup of tea, unwrap your bonbons, plump up your satin embroidered 'Keep Calm and Carry Crack' cushion, and enjwoy.
