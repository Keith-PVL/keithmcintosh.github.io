# 7 x Septembers: A Quick Look Back Through Seven Years of Blogging

## 10th September 2014

I'm joining in with Pips 7 x Septembers tody: a wild trip down a Septembery rabbit hole of the last seven years of blogging. So many memories.

<p Wow,   it's been quite a ride these last years. The best years of my life, in fact. There are those of you reading out there that have been with me ever since I started blogging seven years ago. I appreciate your love and support so very much.</p>

<p Here's hoping the next seven years are as happy, as unpredictable and as chaotically wonderful as the last have been.</p>
