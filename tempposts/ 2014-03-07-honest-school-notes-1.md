# Honest School Notes #1

## 7th March 2014

Dear Office, 

The children were late this morning because Keith started playing the piano and then we got really caught up in trying to get the harmony right on the Juice Newton classic 'Angel of The Morning'. There is a section just after the power note in the middle that is tricky, but if you get it right, it really pulls the whole song together.

Apologies,

Ms McIntosh
