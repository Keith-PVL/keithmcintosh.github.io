# Welcome to 2015: Tales From A Campfire

## 7th January 2015

<p Theda Bara in **Cleopatra**,   1917,   in both the costume and attitude I plan to embody for 2015,   except for the left nipple, which looks painful.</p>

<p Gais! HOW ARE YOU? It's been AGES!</p>

<p *squeals**jogs on spot* *flaps hands wildly*</p>

<p I've been off the writing horse and it takes a little effort to jump back in the saddle, especially at my advanced age (emotional, 14, physical,  86). But I've put my bloggers boots on (vegan-friendly faux leather, Cuban heel) and I'm ready to emote. I am, I am!</p>

<p *flaps hands again*</p>

<p On New Years Eve, I was perched around a campfire in the driveway with my beloved K-Dog and another couple that we've known for half our lives. (Fun fact: K and I first pashed at their wedding, Berrima, 2001. Our **eyes met**. ) We have kids the same age and we aim to always spend New Years Eve together around a fire.</p>

<p We had a vegetarian feast, and overdosed on pavlova, and we played games with the five kids like 'Would You Rather' and 'Which Animal Are You?' We sang campfire songs, chaperoned the sparkler dancing, allowed some late-night Tom and Jerry viewing, and then we packed the smalls  off to bed and rolled into the adult segment of the evening.</p>

<p Pretty soon kids started appearing at the door complaining about each other. Somebody was giggling. Somebody was whispering too loud. Somebody was making funny noises.</p>

<p Keith went in first to reiterate the rules. It's been a big night, you've had a lot of fun, it's sleeping time now. He was firm but kind, as is his wont. As he left, he said 'Now, the next parent that has to come in here is going to be mad, so if I were you, I'd settle down.'</p>

<p Back at the fire, he said 'Right, Rach, you're up next, and you need to be tough. I've sold you up.'</p>

<p On with the festivities. I remembered how to play 'Me and Bobby McGee' on the guitar, employing the Christian strumming I first learned (and cannot unlearn) in the Sacred Heart church aged nine. (A) Father, in my life I (D) see, (A) you are God who walks with (G) me... (I will YouTube this on request.) Much laughing, eating,  singing. There was 'Fernando', a highlight. We began discussing plans for life and the year ahead, and I pulled the party ciggies out of my secret hiding place in a fake book on a high shelf.</p>

<p And then a little face appeared again at the front door.</p>

<p In I went, slightly wobbly navigating the top step, but steady overall, and started with some fairly assertive tucking in of sheets. 'Now, these shenanigans have gone on long enough,' I said. ' I am pretty mad right now. I'm not happy. In fact I must tell you that I am quite significantly annoyed. BUT,' and here I paused and looked at the children one by one, 'I am not as mad as the next parent who has to come in here. Oh, man, they are really going to be super mad. So if I were you, I would go to sleep.'</p>

<p I was pretty pleased with this although I  may have undercut my message a little bit when I called 'Sweet dreams!' at the doorway before doing a little party kick. I was just having too good a time to sustain the fake anger. When I got  back to the fire I told Tam  that she was up next.</p>

<p 'You have to be really really mad', I said. 'However that  manifests for you.'</p>

<p We refreshed drinks, and debated  how to manage the next interruption. With a couple of scientists in the group, we thought perhaps we could apply a little rigour to the situation. What if one went in as an attachment parent, and breastfed them all? Then one as some sort of fundamentalist spare-the-rod parent who spanked them while reciting Romans 8:28? These suggestions went on for some time. I thought in all honesty we should employ the newest theory in the parenting arsenal, the CTFD or 'Calm The Fuck Down' approach, and just let them have the party of their lives until they fell asleep in a heap, but I was voted down.</p>

<p Tam went in and unleashed her serious clinical psychologists stare, but even that did not shut down the party the children were having.</p>

<p Eventually, after we had performed our traditional 'conga line of suckholes' around the fire (a dance that dates from the Mark Latham era of 2004), the familiar little face came back and Tristan went in, the final cog in our wheel of discipline, to end the shenanigans once and for all. He sat in the corner of the bedroom and to every indignant little voice that tried to argue their position or claim innocence of naughtiness, he answered 'I'm not interested. I'm just going to sit here until you go to sleep.'</p>

<p The Silent Presence of The Pissed-Off  Dad. A classic approach, and a successful one. Off they all went to sleepy bobos, that little bunch of funny kids, leaving their parents to enjoy the stars above, the sound of distant fireworks, the easy delight of being with old friends, and the changing over of another year.</p>

<p I think it will be a wonderful one. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p *flaps hands again* *can't stop flapping* *calls the Radio Doctor for sedative*</p>
