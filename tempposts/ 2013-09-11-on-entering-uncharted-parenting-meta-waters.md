Last night at the dinner table,    six year old Peanut said to me  'Mum,   if a kid is yelling a lot and doing  a big drama out of a little scratch, just don't go all worried about  it. '

'You what?' I said.

'You know when they have a scratch and it's not blood or anything but maybe just a white line, you know those white lines you get on your arm? Just don't get, too, all 'oh no, oh, are you all right? Oh, don't worry, little kid' about it."

I tried to catch the thread of logic but it eluded me like smoke, as so often happens in conversation with the under-sevens.

'Do you mean don't pay too much attention to when you guys hurt yourselves?'

'Yep', Ivy said. 'Just get out. Save yourself.'

Did you get this from somewhere?' I asked.

'Politic Parents or something,' she said.

I remembered that she had picked up a parenting book in the bathroom yesterday called Politically Incorrect Parenting, and settled in on the lounge with it. She's taken some points from it, and now she is advising me.

I may be in some trouble here.
