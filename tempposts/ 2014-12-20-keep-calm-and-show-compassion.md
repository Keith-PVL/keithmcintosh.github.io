# Keep Calm and Show Compassion

## 20th December 2014

On this awfully sad day,   at the end of a sad week,   it was perhaps not the best moment to finally read the last chapters of Seven Little Australians to my biggest Peanut. I cried so much when Judy died, I had to keep wiping my face on my dress, and I kept thinking about all the children - in Pakistan, in Queensland, the three left motherless in Sydney... I'm moved by the outpouring of love in Sydney expressed by that sea of flowers, I love #illridewithyou but I'm heartsick so this week, rocked by the fact Â that so much suffering has been enacted on children.

It was a good day to come across a TED Radio Hour special on compassion, and particularly these words from Krista Tippet, host of the podcast <a href="http://onbeing.org/">'On Meaning'.</a>

<blockquote>Compassion is a core virtue that has within it a lot of the other virtues. It's a really central lens on what it looks like to lead a worthy life, with gracefulness and purpose and a sense of meaning. Compassion is kind, and kindness is a kind of everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification.

Compassion is also curious. It cultivates and practices curiosity. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciiation,m but it can also express itself oin the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality too. And to just being there. Just showing up.</blockquote>

My best to you this week. May we all exercise our kindness muscles until they hurt.
