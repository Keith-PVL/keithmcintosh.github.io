# Happy Mother's Day!

## 12th May 2014

Did you have a happy Mothers Day celebration this weekend? I had the family round; my mum and mother-in-law (who I love with the warmth of one thousand suns) and lots of the relatives. We had a lovely pot-luck lunch (good cooks in my family),   the seven-year-old's performed Katy Perry, my nose behaved.

I'm feeling better every day but most of my energy is currently going into keeping my super-cuddly five-year-old's runny nose away from my fresh new one. I'm not much up to thinking fresh thoughts. For Mothers Day, I thought I'd post some links to insights from other writers.

Alison Bendikt from <a href="http://www.slate.com/">Slate </a>made me laugh this week, outlining the ugly truths in her story '<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/04/15/motherhood_is_the_toughest_job_in_the_world_i_ll_elaborate_after_my_nap.html">Motherhood Is The Toughest Job In The World. I'll Elaborate After My Nap.  </a>

<blockquote>And I’ll call my mom! Just as soon as she’s home from playing tennis or bridge or volunteering or whatever it is retired mothers in their late 60s do these days. I probably should have called her this morning, but I was busy sitting down drinking coffee while my three kids played with Legos and my husband showered. I’ll call her just as soon as I finish eating my salad, which I bought with the money that I earn at my real job, where I sit in front of a computer all day, sometimes getting up to stroll over to the table where people leave desserts they’ve brought from home.

Maybe, actually, I’ll just wait to call my mom until after I put the kids to bed tonight, except that I’m really hoping to sit on the couch and binge-watch season two of **Borgen**. I really should, however, call my mom to thank her for making such a delicious Passover Seder for us last night, which was a real lifesaver, since I don’t cook. I’ll try to remember to call her before I go to bed at 11 p.m. and wake up at 7 a.m., but if I forget, I can always call her tomorrow, maybe when I’m walking to the park to exercise in the evening, or I could always skip my afternoon nap this weekend and call her then, except I probably need the nap since I’m only getting eight hours of sleep a night. God, how do I do it? I do not know. You’re welcome.</blockquote>

( I relate to this. In my experience motherhood consists of  intensive bursts of hard work, ameliorated by bouts of restorative laziness.  I got sprung by Keith today multi-task-maximising  my lunchtime relaxation hour by watching Masterchef in the bath with a cup of tea.)

<a href="http://www.cjanekendrick.com/">CJane Kendrick</a>, one of my favourite bloggers (I might be a filthy atheist but jeebus I love me a thoughtful Mormon) adds another take:

<blockquote>....this is how I experience motherhood, it's 99% the practice of self-care and 1% pure sacrifice.

For instance, I teach my children how to clean and pick up because I don't want to spend my whole life doing it myself. I feed them regularly because I fear their blood sugar dropping and the chemical change that turns them into mini Hulks. I beg them to love each other because the shrieking and dramatic displays of injustice easily make me cranky at both the perpetrator and the prosecutor. I take them on walks or to the park to deplete them of energy so I can relish as many hours at night alone as I can possibly milk in one day. And honestly, when I really think about it, I demand manners from them because it butters my ego when I hear people tell me my children are polite.</blockquote>

Finally, the kids tell it.  (If your pelvic floor is weak, you might want to cross your legs before watching this video. It's pretty funny.)

To wrap up, some awkward Mum moments that spoke to my soul:

I cannot lie. I love this Mommysaurus.

Naw. Such a helpful Mum, this one, getting the angles for Kaylee's Tindr profile just right!

Dirty, dirty Granny. I salute you.

Oh yeah, Mum can photobomb.
