Stop!

Don't quit sugar!

Science says its <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2014/04/unhappy-marriages-due-low-blood-sugar">b</a><a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2014/04/unhappy-marriages-due-low-blood-sugar">ad for your marriage</a>.

In a 21-day study of 107 married couples in the US,   researchers found decreased blood glucose levels correlated with decreased self-control and increased aggressive behaviour toward participants’ spouses. Participants were given  voodoo dolls and pins (!) and asked to record their anger levels at different times of day.

In particular,   spouses with lower **evening** sugar levels showed increased aggression towards their special someone.

So there you go folks!  Put the kids to bed,   whip out the  Old Jamaican Rum and Raisin and give your spouse a great big kiss.

Science says.

Happy Easter weekend- we're off road-tripping around visiting relatives and friends for a few days, and I fully intend to eat Easter eggs for the good of my marriage. Generally, I'm out of juice. My body is fighting me, and I'm spending a lot of time in the bath and in the cave. Those of you with any kind of chronic pain know that the cave is not the best place to live.

But onward, upward - all is flux, and all will be well.

Going off line for a few days , and I'll see you all next week.
