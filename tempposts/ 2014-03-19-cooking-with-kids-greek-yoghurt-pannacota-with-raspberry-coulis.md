# Cooking With Kids: Greek Yoghurt Pannacota with Raspberry Coulis

## 19th March 2014

After school,   my kids can tend to be a bit post-institutionalised. They need to wind down and de-stress,   and one of the best ways I've found to direct that slightly stressed energy is into cooking. Particularly cooking that involves licking sweet bowls and spoons.

This pannacotta recipe is particularly suited to an after-school cooking session,   because it needs a few hours in the fridge to cool. If you make it in the afternoon, it should set nicely by dessert. There's also a good amount of measuring - always a good job for little soux chefs - and best of all, there should be a few delicious creamy spoons to lick. (I need three at my house.)

This recipe is adapted from the beautiful blog Smitten Kitchen. Greek yoghurt adds a lovely lightness and tang to the classic pannacotta, which can be very heavy.

**Ingredients**

4 tablespoons (60 ml) water

2 1/2 teaspoons gelatin

2 cups (460 grams) plain full-fat Greek yogurt

2 cups (475 ml) cream

1/4 cup sugar

Juice of half a lemon

**Method**

1. Place water in a small bowl. Stir in gelatin and set aside until the gelatin softens, about 15 minutes.

2. In a large bowl, whisk all of the yogurt and 1 cup of cream.

3. In a small saucepan, bring remaining Â cream and sugar to a simmer and then stir in water-gelatin mixture (it will dissolve immediately) and remove from heat.

4. Whisk this mixture into the yogurt mixture, then stir in lemon juice at the end.

5. Pour the mix into whatever container you are using. I used martini glasses. You could do it in oiled cups or a larger cake pan the larger the container, the longer you will need to chill the pannacotta.) Use your imagination - this dessert would be lovely served in china tea-cups.
