# Five Go Mad In Hobart

## 23rd Whoops 2014

<img class="photo-horiz" src="/images/2014/11/1779247_10152972471551869_4635779487351581011_n1.jpg" />

<p Settled,   happy and loving Hobart. (I'm breaking my no-photos-of-the-kids rule,   just this once.) Here we are,   set up for Mummy School while Keith beaver away on his real job in a little bungalow out the back. Missing the last 5 weeks of terms is giving me the chance to live out a few of my teacher dreams... full report later on whether on not it all pans out or the children band together to have me sacked (in which case I  will be forced to bring back the cane.)</p>

<p We had an excellent road trip down here (two pairs of shoes lost, obscene mess created in car), with lots of stops at museums and parks, a great stopover with family in Melbourne and a smooth, thrilling run across the Bass Strait on the Spirit of Tasmania, the boat that connects Tasmania with the mainland.</p>

<p It's an overnight trip.  I woke up in the early hours of the crossing in our little cabin and felt so, so happy. It was a busy, intense time leading up to this long trip away. Non-stop action. And there we were, the five of us,  floating across the sea, tucked up together in little bunks, sleeping peacefully under clean sheets as the huge boat pitched and rolled gently. Made it! It was a lovely moment.</p>

<p After a few more road-trip shenanigans we  arrived in Hobart a couple of days ago, to a cute little cottage in the inner city. I located the coffee machine, tuned the radio to ABC Hobart, put a load of filthy washing on and ran a bath. Home, home, home.</p>

<p The food is amazing so far and should you care to hear the details (or not! It's too late!) we have all been pooing like elephants. (I think that's good. Robust!  I wonder if all Tasmanian do this? 'Crap like demons' as my friend Sally would say?)  I've had some hot tips on where to eat and shop from Mums and Dads at the park, where all the best information is shared. We've had the most delicious fruit and veges and I've driven past but not stepped inside the Mullet Cafe and the 'Legs N' Breasts!' chicken shop.</p>

<p Yesterday we visited Port Arthur, and shut ourselves in the terrifying 'punishment cell' at the Separation House, where well-meaning prison reformers devised a 'silent treatment' intended to help prisoners think about their sins by removing all distractions. The gaolers did not speak, no contact with other people was permitted at all, and for especially transgressive prisoners, the punishment cell was a small room behind four heavy gates that blocked out all light and sound. You can go in it and shut the door, and you cannot see your hand in front of your face. It's freaky. Amazing museum.</p>

<p I'm reading <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8138329-the-tin-ticket">The Tin Ticket</a>, which tracks the lives of four women convicts, and the kids and I are reading some of Jackie French's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/63263-fair-dinkum-histories">Fair Dinum Histories</a> books.  Tasmania feels soaked in history, and there is gorgeous architecture everywhere we walk.  The clouds are beautiful, and we're off to see a show about mermaids at the Salamanca Arts Centre in the morning.</p>

<p Right now Keith is watching the cricket, drinking beer and eating a Kit Kat, and when I finish writing here I'm going to make a cup of tea and read the Nigella Lawson article in the Vanity Fair mag I found on the bookshelf. The kids will wake up early and start playing in the dog flap; the most brilliant toy they've ever encountered.</p>

<p All is well in Hobart Town.</p>

<p I hope you are all healthy and happy out there too. (And enjoying a vigorous gastro-intestinal reflex. Have a Tasmanian banana, why don't you? See what happens! Let me know.)</p>
