Recently my homies at Mamabake asked their Facebook group how their kids had embarrassed them in the supermarket. Some of the answers had me snorting like a buffalo.

Here's a selection:

"Just last week,   my 3.5 year old pulled down my pants AND undies to my knees,   while I was talking to a friend. I was holding two takeaway coffees,   one on top of the other, so when my pants were around my knees, and my unkept vag and bum was out for half of Tuggeranong to see, I dropped them on his head, while trying to pull them up. He wasn't burned, luckily."

"I grabbed some feminine hygiene packets and miss 4yo said at the top of her lungs "are you getting your bandaids for your undies mum?"

"When I was pregnant with my second recently, my 3 year old told an older lady at the checkout that babies come out your bum hole..."

"My 3 yr old daughter yelled out at top of her voice mummies got a big fat gyna !"

"My 3yo gave me a big hug around my waist, buried his head in my crotch and loudly declared, "I can smell your vagina". Awkward!"

"Pointed to a dude with an eyepatch and called him Captain Feathersword."

"Grabbed a box of tampons ând at the top of her voice asked if i needed some of these to go up my bottom."

I wrote about shopping with young T-Bone once.

<blockquote>Recently, searching the aisles for some random item, I spotted a young shelf-packer. ‘Excuse me, ‘I said, rolling up to him with T-Bone in the toddler seat. ‘Do you know where…?’  Shelf-Boy looked up, and in that moment, T-Bone reached out and pulled my top down to my waist, exposing a full expanse of once-white bra. Time slowed.

I grappled with T-Bone, simultaneously proud and horrified that he seemed to have developed the grip of a professional walnut-cracker. The moment was interminable.  ‘Never mind,’ I eventually choked out and drove on, knockers out and waving in the wind, to the muted strains of Michael Buble. It’s true that Keith and I like to call the Canadian crooner ‘Swinging Bubes’, but on that occasion T-Bone really took things a step too far.</blockquote>

And my big girl Peanut (eight this weekend! Eight!) had some epic moments in her toddler-hood. Apart from that one time she lifted my top and shared with the butcher 'Look! Very fat!', there was one epic tantrum that I handled staggeringly badly.

<blockquote>One memorable day, Peanut– aged two - threw the worst tantrum she’d ever had. It went for forty full minutes. In between shrieking fits, she did quiet moaning exercises, gathering energy for the next attack. I tried desperately to ignore it all, and as it wound down into small hiccoughing gulps, attempted some positive psychology.  'Peanut, you've done a good job controlling yourself for the last few minutes. If you can keep up this happy behavior you can have a balloon from the lady at the door.’ On the way home, with my Stern Voice on, I said ‘Peanut, that was very, very naughty, what you did at the shops. What was going on there?' Peanut was happy to talk though what she learned. 'I did cry and cry and cry, ' she said thoughtfully. 'And then Mummy did give me a balloon.’</blockquote>

You can't win. I comfort myself with the sure knowledge that I will taste my sweet revenge when they are teenagers, as I dance along to Starship in the frozen food section.
