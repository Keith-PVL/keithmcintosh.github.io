# Helping Kids Succeed Socially

## 8th February 2016

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/78476250@N00/2453915505/sizes/z/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt University</a> found the top 10 social skills kids need to succeed in school,   based on surveys of 8,  000 elementary teachers and two decades of classroom research,   are:

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>Listen to others</li>

<li>Follow the steps</li>

<li>Follow the rules</li>

<li>Ignore distractions</li>

<li>Ask for help</li>

<li>Take turns when you talk</li>

<li>Get along with others</li>

<li>Stay calm with others</li>

<li>Be responsible for your behavior</li>

<li>Do nice things for others</li>

</ul>

**Don't label your child as shy.** Instead, acknowledge his feelings and point out that he can overcome his fears. For instance, "Sometimes it takes you awhile to warm up in a new situation. Remember Billy's birthday party, how you held my hand all through the games? But by the end, you were having lots of fun with the other kids."

**Teach your child effective strategies for dealing with shyness. **The general rule of thumb is to accept the nervousness that comes up as a part of normal life that affects most people, reassure yourself that you're ok anyway, and focus on others rather than yourself. For instance, remind your child that she doesn't have to be interesting, just interested, and teach her to ask other kids questions and listen to their answers. Brainstorm with her how she might handle a situation that makes her nervous.</blockquote>
