# Don't Listen To Mums At The School Gate

## 5th February 2015

Yesterday,   at school pick up I got to chatting with a mum beside me. She had a son in kindy and was new to the school. I tried to fill her in on a few things.

She was not rocking the usual 'shagged-through-a-hedge-backwards' - style seen at the gate of our beachside school. No, she was what I like to call a 'ritzy boiler' - full makeup, actual shoes, etc. In conversation I was likely gazing at her slightly open-mouthed in the manner of a four year old girl. 'You're so pretty...'

She had to race off to the shops to pick up blue shorts for sports tomorrow, she told me. No! I stopped her immediately. They don't need blue shorts! grey ones are fine. Just their school shorts, sports shirt and runners. Are you sure, she checked? We've come from a private school where they were very strict about the uniforms...

'Well, you're not at private school anymore, love!' I said in my best Kath and Kim voice, which of course, since she didn't know me, sounded like just my voice. (That's happened to me so many times, I should just stop doing the Kath and Kim voice, but it's like a tic now. It just comes out of it's own accord.)

Sports day this morning, and as I watched all the little boys filed past, i noticed that they were all...wearing...blue...shorts. Except for my T-Bone, wo waved happily as he ran past in his grey ones.

Oh, right, I thought. They wear blue shorts for sport.

Who knew?

I've only been at the school for three years, after all.

Now I'll have to have some weird arward conversation with the new Mum who thinks she's met Rizzo.
