# Harry potter First Draft

## 22nd January 2014

<ul>

<li>Each of the columns is dedicated to a different factor Rowling wanted to keep track of. The first is for the chapter number.</li>

<li>the second is for the timescale of the novel e.g. when the chapter occurs.</li>

<li>In the third column she writes the working title for each chapter.</li>

<li>She then summarizes the plot of each chapter in the fourth column.</li>

<li>After that,   there is a column dedicated to the main plot of the novel and then one for each of the subplots.</li>

<li>There is one row for each chapter,   enabling Rowling to track how each chapter furthers the plot. Every chapter should,   in some way, move the main plot forwards and then each of the subplots can weave into this.</li>

</ul>
