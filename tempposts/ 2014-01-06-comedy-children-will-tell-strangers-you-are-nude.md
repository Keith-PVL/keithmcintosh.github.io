# Comedy Children Will Tell Strangers You Are Nude

## 6th January 2014

Summer is in full swing here in the Southern Hemisphere. The cicadas are shrieking,   the sun is out every day, the car is full of sand.

I'm feeling better than I was last week. A course of steroids for my sinuses are starting to work (at the very least I am confident that my testicles are shrinking). My sore back is improving.

Time spent in nature has been good for my spirit.

This week we ventured deep into the national park, Keith loaded like a donkey, while I carefully watched my step so the threatening lump on my spine didn't pop out and spoil the fun. I was trying hard not to be the nervous, slightly distanced invalid, spectating from a certain remove.

We watched the children swim in waterholes and explore the bush. We ate sandwiches and plums and shook ants off the water bottles.

Keith and I hadn't seen another walker for an hour. The sun was delicious and the shallow water was green and dappled with light. No cossies, alas. What to do? What else?

We got our gear off and floated around in the beautiful, tranquil peace.

Of course, the comedy gods prevailed and not long after stripping off, we heard a couple of young bushwalkers approaching. I pulled Peanut  in front of me and Keith tried to hide behind a boogie board.

'What are you doing?' Peanut said.

'Just be cool,' I said. 'We've got no swimmers on.'

It is, of course, both our blessing and our curse to have raised child comedians. The glint of mischief entered Peanuts eyes.

'My mummy has no clothes on!' she cried.

T-Bone caught on immediately.

'Neither does my daddy!' he shouted. 'My daddy has no clothes on too!'

Peanut ducked under the water and swam away from me, leaving me awkwardly crouched in the shallow water.

'Mummy's in the nude!' she yelled.

'Shhhhhh!' Keith and I hissed at them both. We were laughing though. It was hopeless.  The bushwalkers tried to pick their way past the waterhole discreetly, but the children would have none of it.

'Mummy and Daddy are nude!' Peanut shouted, though she could barely get the words out through her laughter. T-Bone was meticulous as usual. 'This man, and this woman,' he yelled, 'have no clothes on them at all!'

It was perhaps the funniest part of a lovely day. And I was right there in it; not spectating at all.

Good times indeed.
