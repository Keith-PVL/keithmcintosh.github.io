# In Praise Of Crazy Lovebirds

## 9th January 2014

Two of my oldest friends celebrate their eighteenth wedding anniversary today.

They remind me of Paul and Linda.

Damn crazy lovebirds.

<img class="photo-horiz" src="/images/2014/01/tumblr_mjkcz6QQNJ1rt2cl7o1_r1_250.gif" />They also remind me of these words:

**Let us be guests in one another's house**

**With deferential "no" and courteous "yes";**

**Let us take care to hide our foolish moods**

**Behind a certain show of cheerfulness.**

**Let us avoid all sullen silences;**

**We should find fresh and sprightly things to say;**

**I must be fearful lest you find me dull,  **

**And you must dread to bore me anyway.**

**Let us knock gently at each other's heart,**

**Glad of a chance to look within–and yet,**

**Let us remember that to force one's way**

**Is the unpardoned breach of etiquette.**

**So, shall I be host–you, the hostess,**

**Until all need for entertainment ends;**

**We shall be lovers when the last door shuts**

**But what is better still–we shall be friends.**

**Carol Haynes**

Happy anniversary Matt and Shirin!
