# Who Is Poisoning Peregrine Taverner?

## 15th June 2014

I am transported by the colourised Edwardian photographs I came across this week from the excellent <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/edwardians_in_color">Dangerous Minds</a> website.

Actually,   I am having an old-fashioned moment. My dear friend Lucy donated a full Georgette Heyer collection to the Mogantosh library and I am deeply enjoying some Regency romance this week. You may raise your eyebrows at me (just one,   if you are awesome) but listen to this: it seems that Peregrine Taverner has been taking poisoned snuff for the last three days, and if he dies, the bulk of his fortune is entailed to his sister Judith (beautiful, outrageous, drives her own phaeton through Hyde Park at the fashionable hour). Judith and Peregrine are under the guardianship of the brooding, suspicious Earl of Worth. Who is poisoning young Peregrine? Who?

These Edwardian pictures are captivating -  perhaps because, looking back, you can feel the last gasps of Empire - those moments before the frenetic twentieth century began to quicken its pace. I love this description from Dangerous Minds:

<blockquote>The long summers of Edwardian England were a product of the 1920’s imagination, when those who had been children during that decade looked fondly back to a time of seeming innocence. This in part became a theme central to a generation of British artists and writers - <a href="http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/christopher_isherwood_single_man/">Christopher Isherwood</a>, W. H. Auden, Nancy Mitford, <a href="http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/george_orwells_recipe_for_christmas_pudding/">George Orwell</a>, <a href="http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/notes_towards_a_portrait_of_francis_bacon/">Francis Bacon</a>, Evelyn Waugh - all Edwardian children, who produced work that reflected the loss of certainty and identity caused by the Great War.</blockquote>

I also spent ages admiring a set of early 20th century street photography from Paris and London collected by the <a href="http://www.retronaut.com/2012/06/street-fashion-in-london-and-paris-1905-1908/">Retronaut</a> website. It's something of an Edwardian Sartorialist.  The fashions are fabulous.

Another wonderful read if you are feeling **nostaglique **(it's the done thing to throw French into conversation, according to Regency dandy Beau Brummel. **Bein sur.** )  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3238763-the-bolter">The Bolter: Edwardian Heartbreak and High Society Scandal in Kenya</a> is the story of Idina Sackville, written by her great-grand-daughter Frances Osborne. It's a gripping tale that follows the unconventional Sackville from straitlaced Edwardian London to the wild parties of Happy Valley in the 1920's.  I loved it.

Have a lovely week ahead, my friends. If you see me at the school gates, I shall either be wearing the enchanting Lavinia chip tied down with sarcanet ribbons, or the celestial blue bonnet with a jockey-edged front tied down with honeycomb trimming.

C'est magnifique!
