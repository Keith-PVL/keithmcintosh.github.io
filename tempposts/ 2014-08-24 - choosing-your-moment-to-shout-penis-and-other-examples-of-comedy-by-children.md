# Choosing Your Moment to Shout 'Penis!' And Other Examples Of Comedy By Children

## 24th August 2014

<p <span This is life with a three year old: at the dinner table,   I told a funny story about  Peanut as a baby. L</span><span ittle Pudding roared with laughter. 'Oh, yes, dat was a so funny!' she shouted and then stopped when we all turned to look at her. 'Wait', she said. 'Was I there?'  The whole family cracked up then, and Pudding was delighted,  so pleased at her comedic genius that she tried to keep the spotlight on her by yelling 'Penis!' at the top of her voice. (Not a bad trick at a dinner party.)</span></p>

<p Also, life with five year old: 'Do you have gigantism?' T-Bone asked me, out of nowhere last week. 'No, I don't, ' I replied.  But the next day he asked 'Mum, do you have elephantitis?' 'No!' I told him. He didn't ask me the obvious next question: 'Mum, do you have a self-esteem problem?'  Also, last last week at rugby,  T-Bone swore one of the dads was called 'Arkward' until we finally unpicked the situation enough to realise that he'd heard someone point to him in a group and say 'Well, this is awkward'.  He's also said that he's really looking forward to playing in the Under Nines, because the tackling starts then, and so it's like you get lots of cuddles in the game.</p>

<p Gor bless em, kids. They're bloody hilarious.</p>

Happy Monday, everybody! Let's cane this week like a naughty schoolboy.
