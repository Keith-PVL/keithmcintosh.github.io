# Freelee The Banana Girl and Other Modern Freaks

## 8th April 2015

The last time I got sucked so hard down an internet rabbit hole was when I discovered one  of those 'teach yourself....anything!' video-sharing sites. I am a sucker for factoids. I love that stuff. I got sucked further and further in until I found myself watching a step-by-step guide on how to fashion a prosthetic penis (also known as 'packing') out of condoms and hair gel.

Enough! I thought. Put down the laptop and go to sleep. (Perchance to dream,   of interesting adventures.)

Well,   I did it again last weekend when I started looking at the YouTube videos of an Australian 'raw vegan' blogger who calls herself Freelee The Banana Girl, and then I could not stop.

Ah naw.

Menstruation is 'toxic buildup' leaving the body, says Freelee. A healthy woman should have a 'thigh gap'. Etc etc. Her creepy boyfriend enters at one point to say that a raw vegan diet makes his 'banana harder'.

Ew.

Ew.

 

They have a massive YouTube following, these two. So comforting to think about!

Anyway, I still feel dirty from those lost  Youtube hours. Keith was away last week, and I blame the slightly rudderless anxiety that comes upon me when he's not around for more than a couple of days. I  especially found the long-haul flights stressful this time.

I guess Freelee the Banana Girl helped me make it through the lonely, lonely nights.

Otherwise, all is well around here.

Overheard from the kids bedroom last night:

3 y/old:  You're my best friend.

6 y/old:  You're my best friend.

3 y/old:  You're my best friend and my brother.

6 y/old: You're my best friend and my sister.

3 y/old: You're my best friend.

6 y/old: Can we stop doing this now?

Oh, how they make me laugh.

As an antidote to Freelee The Banana Girl (or maybe I just can't stop saying Freelee The Banana Girl) here are a couple of great current affair programs and interviews that I've enjoyed lately.

On The Gist, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist/2015/02/the_gist_bill_browder_on_putin_s_russia_and_sergei_magnitsky.html">Bill Browders tangle with Putin</a> is epic - an amazing, jaw-dropping and sobering listen.

On Background Briefing, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/de-radicalisation-and-the-authentic-voices-of-reason/6342310">Sarah Dingles 2-part report on 'radicalisation'</a> is gripping. It tells the story of how Isis use social media to target young people and turn them towards jihad. It brought to mind the 'flirty fishing' cult techniques of the 70's.

Hope all is well with you all out there, and you are eating your bananas. (51 a day, to be precise. ) According to who, I hear you say?

I'm so glad you asked!

Freelee The Banana Girl.
