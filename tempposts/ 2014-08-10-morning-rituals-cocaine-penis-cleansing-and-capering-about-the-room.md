# Morning Rituals: Cocaine, Penis-Cleansing and Capering About The Room

## 10th August 2014

Guten morgen,   mein little cabbages! Are you up, ready to grab this fine Monday by the rambutans? How are you starting off this week? Does your day hold a formidable smorgasboard of drink and drugs like <a href="_thompsons_typical_daily_intake_of_drink_n_drugs">Hunter S Thompson?</a>

<blockquote>3:00 p.m. rise

12:00 midnight, Hunter S. Thompson is ready to write

12:05-6:00 a.m. Chartreuse, cocaine, grass, Chivas, coffee, Heineken, clove cigarettes, grapefruit, Dunhills, orange juice, gin, continuous pornographic movies.

6:00 the hot tub-champagne, Dove Bars, fettuccine Alfredo

Perhaps you'll start your day like <a href="http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/floyd-mayweathers-morning-ritual-is-absurd/story-fno61i58-1227017751447">Floyd Mayweather</a>, who hired people to announce 'The morning penis is clean'?

Me, I incline towards James Boswell's technique.  In 1763, he advised:

<blockquote>'As soon as you have huddled on your clothes, open your chamber window and throw your head out, keeping your mouth wide open in order to feast upon the fresh air.  In this posture remain for near the space of a quarter of an hour. Then proceed to bodily exercise by dancing and capering about your room for near twenty-five minutes.'</blockquote>

Overall l, I find it very, very hard to go past the fine morning work of Rogerant Tshibangu, and I think I shall combine systems: ingest cocaine, clean my morning penis, feast on some fresh air and then shake what my mother gave me while I iron my sharp, sharp suit. Happy Monday, my friends! May it continue on well, however it begins.
