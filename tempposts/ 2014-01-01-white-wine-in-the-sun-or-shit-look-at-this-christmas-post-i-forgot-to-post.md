# White Wine In The Sun Or; Shit, Look at This Christmas Post I Forgot To Post

## 1st January 2014

**Haven't been here for a week. And look! Forgot to post what appears to be a heartwarming message brimming with Christmas spirit. Buggerit,   will post it now, while I think about how to write about New Years.  Oops. See you in half an hour. **

Are you hosting Christmas at your place this year?

Yes?

Bloody hell, I salute you.

How are you doing all the crazy Christmas prep and still keeping your house guest-ready? My place looks like a glitter bomb went off. It would be demoralising if I had a minute to think about it. I think it feels worse because I'm sick right now, I'm SO TIRED, so I'm lumping about the place like a wet blanket, muttering lists, and I tell you, if I had five bucks for every time I've said '**ah,** **fe**r** fucksake**' I would not have blown my Christmas budget.

I definitely need a break in the weather. Some down-time to reboot the system. And perhaps, mop the floor.

Tomorrow Keith stops work for a bit, and we're looking forward to some screen-free time. No little blinking  blue lights for a while. Rather, books and couches and pianos and sandy feet and maybe a campfire or two.

It's been a big year. My plan is to return to you in a week or so with a nicely adjusted attitude.

Happy Christmas to you and yours! May your days be merry and bright. x

Here's Tim Minchin.
