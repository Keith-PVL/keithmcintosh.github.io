# The End of The Adventure

## 17th October 2016

Home from our travels,   where the T-Bone,   like a cat,   immediately re-accqainted himself with his favourite spot: in a patch of sunshine in Mum and Dads bed. I didn't have to put butter on his paws or anything.

As for me, I immediately re-acquainted myself with the normal run of Sunday: 4 loads of washing, purchasing half the supermarket, producing meals every ten minutes, washing the school clothes and searching for the hats (unsuccessfully.)

That right, I remembered. In real life I am Cinderella.

For the last 2 weeks we've been on the move; riding on the back of trucks, sleeping in tree-houses with rats, eating whatever is placed in front of us, and wearing the same two filthy outfits. Amazing how much time in the day there is when two parents are there to negotiate the battle that has erupted during the children's game of Farting Rainbows, when you have no laundry to do (rather, no way to do the laundry you have), and when you have no food to cook, and must just wait for 'dinner' and whatever appears then, good or bad.

With all that time, we played endless games of cards and Bananagrams, read books and slept. It was a marvellous, epic adventure, one that has opened our eyes to many possibilities, and now that we are back, I feel a little smothered by all the stuff in my house. Be warned, Salvation Army. Mama has the crazy eyes.

Pics and details to follow - for now, I have a lengthy to-do list to tackle. First item on the agenda: start dreaming of the next adventure.
