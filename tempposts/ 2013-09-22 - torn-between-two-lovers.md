# Torn Between Two Lovers

## 22nd September 2013

<p <span The two year-old and the five-year old are engaged in a pitched battle over a single resource right now: the mother. 'Punarn!',   toddler Pudding tells me constantly. (This is 'come on' in the Queens English. It's her favourite word. ) 'Looka my singing! Looka my dancing! Punarn, Mummy! Punarn!'  Now matter how much I looka, it's never enough.</span></p>

<p Five year old T-Bone is going through a bit of a moment. His volume is stuck on eleven, and he's off with the fairies. I'm reading a book called 'The Way Of Boys' and trying to understand. He's calling me to be more: more patient, more attentive. I'm trying. Failing.  And trying again. So it goes.</p>

<p We're better confined to barracks for a bit. Lately, if we're out and about, the two of them start battling over the territory of my legs, trying to climb me like a tree and out-whinge each other. Their needs are not so demanding really. Puddingjust wants me to dance with her like Igglepiggle (all day long), and the T-Bone  just wants me to do craft or read his inventions book to him (all day long.) So as we roll into the school holidays, I'm going to stop fighting. I'm going to take a deep breath and rise to the occasion. It's craft and Igglepiggle moves for the duration.</p>

<p Friday night, all is well.  Roasted chicken for dinner, the kids hammering K and I  in a heated game of Mille Bornes, and a long bath with a packet of Maltesers and Henry James. K is watching the footy and fiddling with his algorithms (no euphemism). Soon, I'll take my cup of tea , hot-water bottle and laptop  into bed and read some of my bookmarked articles before I the glasses drop off my middle aged nose and I honk myself awake with a sudden start.</p>

<p Good times. The best.</p>

<p Have a great weekend, my friends. May it be fabulous, and filled with all that you love.</p>
