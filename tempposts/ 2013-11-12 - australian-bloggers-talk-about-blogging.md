# Australian Bloggers Talk About Blogging

## 12th Whoops 2013

Blogging is a strange thing to do. Here are my thoughts,   world! Here are some more I thought today! Have some feelings! More more more! It's a a vehicle for a particular brand of show-pony; a person,   tapping away behin a laptop,   with a the battle against narcissm and content; your brand is the story that your content revolves around,

Some bloggers have a mix of charisma and wit and flair for words. They are vulnerable enough to share their weaknesses and narcissistic enough to think those weaknesses are important, that they say something about the human condition, something worthy of sharing with others.You have to HI Beth,

<div>How's it going? I'm writing a post about the nature of blogging and I'm trying to dig into that idea of how bloggers sit with the show-pony aspect of writing, every day, about ourselves.</div>

<div></div>

<div>My theory is that it takes a certain amount of narcissm to think that our opinions are important enough to be written about, but...does that really matter?</div>

<div></div>

<div>Bloggers are creating content for others to enjoy. For free.</div>

It's less painful, frankly.</a>', Eden with <a href="http://www.edenriley.com/2012/10/i-am-mummyblogger.html">'I Am Mummy-Blogger'</a>. Mel from <a href="http://coalvalleyview.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/its-not-all-beer-skittles.html">Coal Valley View </a>explored the need for new mums, especially, to see teh nuanced ad mundane life of life with kids.</div>

<div>, Bloggers massage and craft sentences, take and edit photographs, code and design and build and support communities of people. They comment on each others websites and negotiate complex relationships with readers who develop a vested interest in the story they have connected with. The 'brand' of that blogger.</div>

I love many of the blogs I read and I feel real empathy and compassion and affection for those writers. There are lots of bloggers I feel like I would be friends with in real life. But blogs are not real life. They are fiction, or perhaps, creative non-fiction. They are as real as memoir, as real as autobiography. They are as real as 'history' is real, and 'truth' is real. Whih is not to say that they are inauthetic; just that they are written by people, and we are notoriously terrible at seeing ourselves clearly.

The writers I like try,  though. They are not afraid to be vulnerable and explore parts of themselves, and I appreciate them for doing this. It shows us we are together in it; trying to understand parenting, marriage,

But it's something of a  poisoned beaker. Some bloogers seem trapped in a kind of golden handshake - a blog that began about their family life has become an income stream over time, until there they are, trapped in a brand that they must keep shilling. What to do with issues of privacy? With the maddening drain that writing about oneself every day must become?  How do you share 'authentically' about yourself while remaining true to a brand that has

utthat means you keep reading; but it's a bit of a popisoned challice - you get more readers, you keep writiong; you're trapped in a daily land - an income stream - of 'me! me! And another thing about me! Enhough about me. Let's talk about you. What do you think of me?

I think as bloggers you have to swallow that. The nobbiness of writing about yourslef. The twepiness.The narcissm.
