# No More Babies (And A Giveaway Winner!)

## 13th August 2014

My tiniest cabbage turned three yesterday.

My heart!

She has moved into a toddler bed and for the first time in seven years,   there is no cot in my house.

I feel it deeply, this sense of moving away from the baby zone our family has been immersed in for so long. The pull to have more babies is a deep, deep desire in me. But my last pregnancy was so tough I could not put my body through that again. And Keith and I started making children late - so, although we both feel sad about it, I am done with birthing babies.

One day, when the kids are all bigger, I want us to become a foster family. But for now, the land of nappies and mashed pumpkin and late nights spent walking the halls are over. No more dummies and strollers and bottles. No more trying desperately to interpret the cries of a distressed little one that can't speak. (Pudding is so far past this that she critiques my outfits. 'Aw thats a cute pants Mama.You look a cute Mama. But I not like your hair.')

I feel the next phase of family life starting to envelop us, as little Pudding inserts herself with such confidence into the activities of the big ones. I can see that life with kids, rather than babies, can have a whole different rhythm. Times are changing. We've all been curled up together lately on the big couch watching Modern Family. The big kids can both kick my arse in card games. They can swim. We're talking about travelling, spending time on the floor together poring over maps. We're going to buy a canoe.

They still need me, these kids - they are still so small! - but I can see that they are one step further along in their process of childhood - which is, after all, a journey of cumulative independence. Day by day, they are becoming more able to survive by themselves, and day by day, they don't need their Mum like they used to.

It all make me so happy. I love these three children with every cell in my body, and I am thrilled and proud to see every step they takes towards adult life. But still, I feel like I want to cry.

Like a baby.

ps - In a crazy-eyed organisation frenzy over the weekend,  I unearthed a Baby Bjorn carrier that <a href="http://mogantosh.com/on-meeting-bloggers-in-real-life-and-a-giveaway-for-you/#comments">I ran a giveaway for </a>and never drew! Because highly professional blogger, etc. So - late , but with love - I have closed my eyes, pointed at the screen and picked a winner: Emma Woodley, interiors guru, it be you!  If your brother's baby is now too giant for sling-land, let me know and I will take it to a local mums-and-babies charity.
