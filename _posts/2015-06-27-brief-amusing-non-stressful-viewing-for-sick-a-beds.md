# Brief, Amusing, Non-Stressful Viewing for Sick-A-Beds

## 27th June 2015

If you are stuck in bed,    sick,  sore or recovering from surgery, chances are you have only enough attention for short and non-stressful viewing. (Take a hot tip from me and don't watch Game of Thrones while coughing up blood.)

I have this ongoing web-series list that I sometimes update, and I  like to send it to sick  friends. I don't think I've ever posted it here, though, so here we go: short shows, funny and offbeat, suitable for all illnesses including man-flu and homicidal PMT. (It's a thing! Science says it'<a href="http://jezebel.com/pms-bitchiness-is-real-and-it-is-spectacular-1621115726">s a real thing!)</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V_DsL1x1uY">Drunk Histories </a>- actors get shitfaced, re-enact scenes from history.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpsI8mWKmg">This is one of Amy Schumers best</a>, but everything she does makes me laugh until I wee.

<a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/highmaintenance/videos">High Maintenance:</a> a pot dealer makes his daily rounds, reviewed by one critic as 'Girls, but hazier'.





<a href="http://theslopeshow.com/episodes/">Park Slope: </a>two superficial, homophobic lesbians from Brooklyn are hilarious.

<a href="http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/">Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</a>: Jerry Seinfeld does, you know, what the title says. I especially love Louis CK and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss here.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/7minutesinheaven">7 Minutes In Heaven</a>: comedians share a short, awkward and outrageous moment in a closet with Mike O'Brien, ending always with his attempt to make out with them. His pash with Ellen Degeneres is a particular highlight.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UZJRR8OHhY">The Katering Show</a>: The journey of a food intolerant and an intolerable foodie - Australian, really funny.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwLs6vxLik">Celebrities read mean tweets. </a>

<span Know any more? Let me know and I'll add them to my list. And if you're not well, I hope you feel better soon. It sucks to be sick. It bites the weiner, as Shakespeare said.</span>

Finally, one of my all-time faves. Dirty Jamie Oliver's going to whack it into your burger, again and again and again. I will never, ever tire of this internet classic.
