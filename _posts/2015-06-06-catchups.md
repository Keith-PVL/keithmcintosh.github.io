# catchups

## 6th June 2015

managing illness or injury is like adding a pet time job to your schedule.

 

Im trying this new thing called guaferesin but it's habit-forming and I do not like the picture of doing the school rin like Lil Wayne,   cluching a big sippy cup of crank.(red bull+ cough mixture, if you're making dinner party plans.)
