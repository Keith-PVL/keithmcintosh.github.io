# Taking Stock

## 30th May 2016

Like <a href="http://meetmeatmikes.com/">Pip</a>,   I'm taking a minute to stop,   smell the roses and capture a little of this moment in time.

**Reading:** White Eskimo, the story of polar explorer and super-hottie Knud Rasmussen, who mapped and explored Greenland in the early 20th century. I love a good explorer tale - ( here I've written a list of <a href="http://mogantosh.com/bookshelf-man-versus-wild/">some good Man Vs Wild books</a>, and here a list of some <a href="http://mogantosh.com/bookshelf-adventurous-women/">women adventurers)</a>. Rasmussen is very cool, and also, SO PRETTY.

Come on! Imagine that face, speaking Greenlandic through a mouthful of whale blubber, and you have my dreams.

I'm also loving Edmund White's 'Inside a Pearl: My Years In Paris' ; 'Life Below Stairs: True Lives of Edwardian Servants' and re-reading the Amanda Foreman biography of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, one of my all-time favourite women of history.  The kids and I are reading Dahl's Danny, The Champion Of The World.  (So lovely. One of his best.)

**Eating:** A lot of what we call 'horses dinners' - a sort of random snacking plate.  I don't like to advertise on the social medias when Keith is away, but he's been in China. I'm in the single mother zone and there are  and Wagon Wheels and Coke in the fridge. Nuff sed. He's back now. Roast lamb appeared in celebration.

**Watching:** Things have been quite fraught around here, to be honest. My father-in-law is very sick, Keith is stressed and sad and busy. I was so buggered after he left last week  that I watched Sex and The City 2, just to see if the movie was as bad as I remembered, and it was, of course, WORSE, even, unbelievably, comically bad. Then, later, I found myself watching Sex and The City 1, just to see the progression of shame. So weirdly reminiscent of some pre financial-crisis, gone-forever time, I told my Wagon Wheel.

Also, I went down a delightful rabbit hole of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs3DzydSKu8" target="_blank">Tate Studio </a>vids on Youtube, and some Vogue<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W511rtnnlZM" target="_blank"> 73 Questions </a>(Sarah Jessica's house is gorgeous, Iggy Azalea is a weird fembot). The kids and I have been enjoying watching Catalyst archives while we eat our horses dinners.

I watched Marley and Me with the girls - beware! Don't try this before bedtime! The last twenty minutes are tragic. I didn't see it coming (I'm sharp like that) and it took me forever to calm them down enough to go to bed.  FYI - when you have two daughters sobbing on either side of you, don't say  'It's really OK! All dogs die! Everything dies!' It does not help the situation.

**Resting**: my head on the electrical tape the holding my bath together while I dream about interior design projects of the future. (All in good time, grasshopper.)

**Sharing**: my bed with the children, who take it in turns to 'be Daddy' when Keith is away. This means they get to tuck up in the big bed, so important and special, at bedtime, and then I tell them 'now, prepare to get cuddled in your sleep.' Frankly, it's a moot point, whose turn it is to be Daddy, because by the early hours, all three of them are in the bed. They press up so tight against me that I feel as though I am in some sort of old-timey prison cell where there is not quite enough room for us all to lie down together and at some signal we all must turn over at the same time. It's terrible and lovely - they are so cuddly and warm, their strong little arms and legs so gorgeous - but it is also painful and hideous.

Also, wee.

**Pondering**: Whether the hat I bought is wrong. In the shop it read 'boho' and now it is reading 'Amish'. Hats! You kill me, Hats.

**Listening:** Two Dope Queens. Yaaaaas! Also, the Carol soundtrack.

**Trying**: Not to touch anything on the backseat floor of my car. It has moved beyond disgusting to scientifically interesting.

**Laughing**: at the children. 'What you thinking about T-Bone?' 'I was imagining what disgusting sandwiches I could feed the dog if we ever get one.'

**Scrambling:** Under last minute instructions: I need this note signed today. I need a superhero costume for the morning. I need to finish my speech before bed. I need my old soccer socks for tomorrow.

Honestly, this guy captures the tone so perfectly! God this made me laugh.

**Writing:** Not much. The Mumming has been intensive.

**Planning: **to get started on my embroidery project. I just need a hoop for the K Dog and I have everything else ready to go. I'm looking forward to some winter fun listening to podcasts about Donald Trump and doing embroidery with my boyfriend.  Once he gets home from his Talking From My Balls mens group on Thursdays, that is. Of course.

**Making:** A long-overdue photo book of our Tasmanian adventures (and thinking I should really include <a href="http://mogantosh.com/a-topless-holiday-postcard/">that story about the topless gardener</a>, which still cracks me up.)







**Appreciating-** Keith getting home safely. All's well with my world again. Although, even less room in the bed.





**Respecting:** As always, when Keith is away, single mothers. You are amazing!

 

 

How are you? What are you watching, reading, avoiding, marinating? I hope you and your beloveds are well and happy out there. x
