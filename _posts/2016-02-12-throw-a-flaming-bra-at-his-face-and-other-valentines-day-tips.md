Why not stage a retro cat-fight this Valentines Day? Fun!

I have done something most unsexy to my back and am out for the count,   temporarily. But I have booked a romantic night out at the theatre with Keith for next weekend,   so I have a deadline to whip my body back into shape.

If you are trying to keep things unusual in the boudoir this Valentines Day, some advice: you might like to 'sexually surprise' your partner by, f'instance,  putting a g-string on the roast duck or hiding chocolates in your vagina. Just like Jane Austen would do!  These and other excellent tips <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lorynbrantz/9-ways-to-sexually-surprise-your-man-this-valenti?bffbmain&amp;utm_term=.nxNqz1Q4M#.aoXnzlYrX">here</a>.

This article cracked me up, and it  reminded me how much fun I used to have writing my Sex Tips From The Past series. Might have to bring that one back!
