## 17th July 2015

post keith tryip,   school hols,   4 days fam visits (highlights,   the antipaleo restaurant, the corin forest, questacopn, questacon stories)

Feeling a little Bullet Journal

Up early mornings writing

So cold! George shouting No Way Hose! and 'I'll take that as a yes. Ivy reading Harry Potter. Ted loving colouring in and listening to Raold Dahl audiobooks. He's swings betwene his two setting - timid as a mouse and wild like buffalo.

Loving the liz gilbert podcast and the mortified podcast, reading My Salinger Year and the Du Marier sisters, tonight, watching Mrs Doubtfire and eating roasted potatotes.

Swimming lessons start tomorrow. We think Gorge will just swim away, even though she's never had lessons. We all actually do think this, which is notable. We think she is some kind of super-person and we are all obsessed with her and her general brilliance. For instance, her current two favorite phrases: 'no way, Jose' and 'I'll take that as a yes'.

That's not going to work out badly is it?

Dr Freud?

Hello?

All is well. And with you? Hope your holidays went well.

Im off to the Golden Door in A WEEK!
