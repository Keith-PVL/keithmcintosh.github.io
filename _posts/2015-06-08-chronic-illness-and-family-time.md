# Chronic Illness and Family Time

## 8th June 2015

I've been a bit under the weather the last week or so.

This chronic sinusitus problem I've been juggling for a couple of years now is an up-down adventure. It's a lot better since having surgery a year ago,   but the underlying problem - a chronic inflammatory response in my sinuses - remains. So my sinuses swell,   the bacteria that is easily flushed through a normal system is more easily trapped,   so I'm prone to infection. After infection, after infection. Then my immune response kicks in and makes more mucus. Yummy, yummy. My sense of smell is gone, and I'm really hoping that's not permanent, but nobody can say for sure.

Before my surgery I spent about 100 days on anti-biotics. Since, I'm still getting sinus infections, and am trying my best to fight them without anti-biotics (sometimes successful, sometimes not.) Next step is to see an immunologist (Sydney or Wollongong suggestions welcomed) to see if there is an underlying immne system disease or dysfunction.

I've done everything else - tried giving up gluten, dairy, sinus osteopathy. I flush out my sinuses at least once a day with salted water and steroids. I'm taking Vitamin C and multi's and olive leaf. Broth. Lots of water. Blah blah blah. Managing chronic illness is like adding a part-time job to your life. This week I've been trying a new thing where you take cough mixture throughout the day. It's active ingredient guanerferin has a mucus-thinning effect, so it can help to stop mucus being trapped and avoid infection. It's disgusting though - and drinking cough mixture is habit forming, so local mums, if you see me at the school run with a Slushy cup full of Red Bull and Robotussin (I think Lil Wayne calls it 'crank'), stage an intervention.

Ah, such fun. I'll go on, shall I?

My back's been good lately, but it went out a bit this week. I've had a spine full of hardware for twenty years, and it has occasional weird moments. One of its party tricks is to pop out of place (nobody can explain exactly why) so that a golf-ball sized knob sticks t the back. Whut? The hells thut?

The problem is having to be the emotional barmoter of the family. Everything is thirty percent harder , and little kids are so finely-tuned to your emotional state. When I am impatient and irritable, they act up. The phrase 'I am not Cinderella you know!' gets more of a run some days than others. Â Everything, everything is on the floor. Housework involves so much bending and carrying. I fantasis about a house where a long shelf runs through every room at mid-height, and I can Thunderbird about the place, getting everything done and never having to bend at the waist. It hurts my back to bend, and when I get my head down, my sinuses give me a kick.

If I was a horse, I'd be having nightmares about the glue factory.

Anyway, I felt the need to vent here, to explain my absence a bit, to try and explain some of the things that people go through behind the scenes.There are so many of us living with chronic pain, to some degree (one statistic I found claimed ).

You save your energies for the essentials, like driving kids about, getting the shopping done, the dinner on the table, the washing on the line. But the second-level of living gets neglected. Properly cleaning some filthy room. Getting down on the floor. After a while, the stuff you're not getting to really does start to weigh on you.

Happy house-holding, for me, requires a certain level of energy. There's the basics, then there's the hard-work of keeping things running well, then there's the fun stuff, then there's the lighthearted atmosphere.

 

dont want to overrstae. 'm fine - I'm not that sick, my back threatened to go and didnt - all is ok. but that's the story.

My backs been
