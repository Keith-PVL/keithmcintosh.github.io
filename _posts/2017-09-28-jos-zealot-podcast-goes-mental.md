# Jo's Zealot Podcast Goes Mental

## 28th September 2017

My old friend Jo Thornely hit #1 in the iTunes comedy charts recently with 'Zealot' ,   her podcast exploring the cults you know and love,   and a few you might have missed.

You can find the full episode list [here](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/zealot/id1245635983?mt=2).

I recorded Episode 5 with Jo a few months ago. It's about the Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh, in which Jo and I have a great time exploring the wacky world of 80's bio-terrorism, make bad jokes about the Indian city 'Pune' and invent a nursing home called 'Tough Titties Meadows'.

The Bhagwans right-hand woman was Sheila, who you might remember from her classic burn on 60 Minutes' Mike Willesee: 'good luck to you and your pimps.'

The jokes, they write themselves.

Recently Jo's podcast has been rocketing up the iTunes comedy charts, which is an amazing achievement for a lady whose prior career high was [smelling Jermaine Jackson](http://mogantosh.com/interesting-people-jo-thornely/) (olfactory report: like new-car leather from a cow that only ate gardenias.) SO PROUD of Jo! She had an idea, she went and made a thing, and now the thing is going crackers.

Go out, comrades! Go out and make the thing! Be like Jo!

My favourite iTunes review: 'Hilarious, crude and immature. It’s absolutely perfect.'  Which is probably how I would describe my darling old mate Jo.

Go, listen, subscribe, review, eat the t-shirt, sign up to sign your autumn years at Tough Titties, and enjoy!
